/**
 * This is one of the main data structures in OpenTripPlanner. It represents a mathematical object
 * called a graph (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) relative to which many routing
 * algorithms are defined. A graph is made up of vertices and edges. These are also referred to as
 * nodes and arcs or links, but in OTP we always use the vertices and edges terminology.
 * <p>
 * In OTP1, the Graph contained vertices and edges representing the entire transportation network,
 * including edges representing both street segments and public transit lines connecting stops. In
 * OTP2, the Graph edges now represent only the street network. Transit routing is performed on
 * other data structures suited to the Raptor algorithm (the TimetableRepository). Some transit-related
 * vertices are still present in the Graph, specifically those representing transit stops,
 * entrances, and elevators. Their presence in the street graph creates a connection between the two
 * routable data structures (identifying where stops in the TimetableRepository are located relative to
 * roads).
 * <p>
 * Other data structures related to street routing, such as elevation data and vehicle parking
 * information, are also collected here as fields of the Graph. For historical reasons the Graph
 * sometimes serves as a catch-all, as it used to be the root of the object tree representing the
 * whole transportation network. This use of the Graph object is being phased out and discouraged.
 * <p>
 * In some sense the Graph is just some indexes into a set of vertices. The Graph used to hold lists
 * of edges for each vertex, but those lists are now attached to the vertices themselves.
 * <p>
 * TODO RT_AB: I favor renaming to StreetGraph to emphasize what it represents. TG agreed in review.
