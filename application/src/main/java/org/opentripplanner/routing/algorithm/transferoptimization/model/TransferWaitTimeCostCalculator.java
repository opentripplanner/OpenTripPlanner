/**
 * This calculator uses the {@code minSafeTransferTime}(t0) and an inverse log function to calculate
 * waiting time cost. The goal is to maximize the overall waiting time and distribute the waiting
 * time evenly between each transfer.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is a BEST GUESS, we do not have any scientific support for the function
 * used.
 * <p>
 * First let look at an example. The transfer times(t) are in minutes:
 * <pre>
 *     Leg 1        Origin --- A --------- B
 *     Transfer 1               \ t=1       \ t=3
 *     Leg 2                     C --- D --- E --- F
 *     Transfer 2                       \ t=7       \ t=4
 *     Leg 3                             G --------- H --- Destination(Z)
 * </pre>
 * In this example there is 3 valid paths with the following transfers:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Alt 1: A-C and D-G with 1 + 7 = 8 minutes total</li>
 *   <li>Alt 2: A-C and F-H with 1 + 4 = 5 minutes total</li>
 *   <li>Alt 3: B-E and F-H with 3 + 4 = 7 minutes total</li>
 * </ol>
 * The best alternative here is Alt 3, which is the best compromise between maximizing the travel
 * time and avoiding the short transfer time(1 minute) at A-C, which is only 1 minute.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   t0 : MinSafeTransferTime
 *   N  : A constant cost factor such that f(0) = N * t0

 *
 * The function f(t) is:
 *
 *
 *              N * minSafeTxTime
 *    f(t) = ------------------------------
 *            1 + (N - 1) * ln(1 + A * t)
 *
 *
 * The function is created so the following is true:
 *
 *   f(0) = N * t0
 *   f(t0) = t0
 *
 * A is a constant that is calculated like this:
 *
 *     A :=  (e - 1) / t0

 * minSafeTxTime is 2 minutes and 10 minutes:

 * <b>Why use a 1/log function?</b>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *     First of all we want to maximize the total transfers time across all transfers
 *     in the journey. This makes sure we do not stay on a trip longer than needed and
 *     avoid back-travel.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Second, we want to avoid VERY short transfers. The function above favor the set
 *     of transfers [3,5] over [2,6] and [2,6] over [1,7] - a linear function would not.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Any 1/logN would be suitable, but log with base 10 is chosen (Supported in Java).
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     We use this only to adjust the transfers within a single itinerary, not to compare
 *     two itineraries with each other.
 *   </li>
 * </ol>

   * The optimized transfer normally do not need to account for transfer constraints, but we want a

   * wait-times of the facilitated transfer are. We also need to account for the case where we have
   * to choose between facilitated transfers.
   * <p>
   * Here is an example with to possible paths: {@code A-B-D-E-H-J} and {@code A-C-F-G-I-J}, the
   * {@code \} is a normal transfer and the {@code \\} is a guaranteed transfer. The path {@code

   * To achieve this we give a restricted transfer a big negative cost - bigger than any possible
   * optimized-wait-time cost (to achieve point 1 above), and we use a constant cost (to achieve
   * point 2).
   * <p>
   * We give stay-seated an advantage over guaranteed by using a smaller cost as well.
