/**
 * This filter is useful if you want to remove those results where there is a short bicycle
 * leg followed by parking the bike and taking transit. In such a case you would not need a bike
 * could just walk to the stop instead.
 * <p>
 * This filter does not follow the regular filter framework as it is intended only for use cases where
 * several queries are combined in the frontend.
 * <p>
 * Example: you have two queries for bike+transit and walk+transit each. Both give you very short legs
 * to reach a train station. A user would not expect to see a bike+transit shorter than 200m leg when it's
 * presented right next to a walk+transit leg of the same length.
 * <p>
 * In other words, this offloads the comparison part of the filter chain to a system outside of OTP and
 * that is the reason for this non-standard approach.
