/**
 * A TransitAlertService stores a set of alerts (passenger-facing textual information associated
 * with transit entities such as stops or routes) which are currently active and should be provided
 * to end users when their itineraries include the relevant stop, route, etc.
 *
 * Its primary purpose is to index those alerts, which may be numerous, so they can be looked up
 * rapidly and attached to the various pieces of an itinerary as it's being returned to the user.
 *
 * Most elements in an itinerary will have no alerts attached, so those cases need to return
 * quickly. For example, no alerts on board stop A, no alerts on route 1 ridden, no alerts on alight
 * stop B, no alerts on route 2 ridden, yes one alert found on alight stop C.
 *
 * The fact that alerts are relatively sparse (at the scale of the entire transportation system)
 * is central to this implementation. Adding a list of alerts to every element in the system would
 * mean storing large amounts of null or empty list references. Instead, alerts are looked up in
 * maps allowing them to be attached to any object with minimal space overhead, but requiring some
 * careful indexing to ensure their presence or absence on each object can be determined quickly.
