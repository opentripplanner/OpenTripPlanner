   * Summarizing from http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/csdl/learn_datum.html:
   * Like GPS, OpenStreetMap uses the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84) coordinate system,
   * and altitudes in OSM are measured relative to the WGS84 datum. On the other hand, USGS
   * elevation data from the National Elevation Dataset (NED, http://ned.usgs.gov/) are
   * referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
   * The NAVD88 datum used by NED is an "orthometric" datum based on mean sea level in one
   * particular part of the world; the so-called 3D datums used in GPS and OSM are ellipsoids
   * intended to cover the whole Earth. Orthometric datums like NAVD 88 are equipotential
   * (gravitational) surfaces of the Earth (geoids [1]) which include the effects of topography
   * because the Earth's mass is irregularly distributed. Ellipsoid datums like NAD83 are smooth
   * geometric approximations of the earthâ€™s surface (ellipsoids) without topography.
   * Differences between the two are significant (up to 100 meters).
   *
   * Current geoid models relate NAD83 ellipsoid heights to NAVD88 orthometric heights, i.e.
   * the geoid for the continental United States is calibrated against and defined relative to
   * the GPS ellipsoid.
   *
   * According to http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=561, "it is generally assumed
   * that WGS 84 (original) is identical to NAD 83 (1986)."
   * According to http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/csdl/learn_datum.html "there is a 2 meter
   * difference between two of the most frequently used 3-D datums, the North American Datum of
   * 1983 (NAD 83) and the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS 84)."
   *
   * In OTP we convert between these two systems using one of these geoids defined relative
   * to an ellipsoid. The rasters describing the datum are not included in OTP by default because
   * they double the size of the OTP distribution, but are only needed by people loading
   * elevations in North America.
   *
   * In OTP we perform the conversion using a geoid defined relative to the NAD83 ellipsoid.
   * This is backed up by an NOAA publication at
   * http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc95-19408.pdf stating they are for all
   * practical purposes identical, especially when using handheld equipment. NAD 83 and WGS 84
   * ellipsoid equivalence is also explained in a post at
   * http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=97337.
   *
   * The datum rasters must be downloaded from the OTP website and placed in the NED cache directory.
   * TODO they could be fetched automatically from a static URL on the opentripplanner website.
