    If you have multiple overlapping flex zones the high default value can lead to performance problems.
    A lower value means faster routing.
    
    Depending on your service this might be what you want to do anyway: many flex services are used
    by passengers with mobility problems so offering a long walk might be problematic. In other words,
    if you can walk 45 minutes to a flex stop/zone you're unlikely to be the target audience for those
    services.
