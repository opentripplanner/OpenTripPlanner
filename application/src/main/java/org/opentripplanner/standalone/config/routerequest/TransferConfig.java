The main purpose of transfer optimization is to handle cases where it is possible to transfer
between two routes at more than one point (pair of stops). The transfer optimization ensures that
transfers occur at the best possible location. By post-processing all paths returned by the router,
OTP can apply sophisticated calculations that are too slow or not algorithmically valid within
Raptor. Transfers are optimized is done after the Raptor search and before the paths are passed
to the itinerary-filter-chain.

To toggle transfer optimization on or off use the OTPFeature `OptimizeTransfers` (default is on).
You should leave this on unless there is a critical issue with it. The OTPFeature
`GuaranteedTransfers` will toggle on and off the priority optimization (part of OptimizeTransfers).
              
The optimized transfer service will try to, in order:
              
1. Use transfer priority. This includes stay-seated and guaranteed transfers.
2. Use the transfers with the best distribution of the wait-time, and avoid very short transfers.
3. Avoid back-travel
4. Boost stop-priority to select preferred and recommended stops.
              
If two paths have the same transfer priority level, then we break the tie by looking at waiting 
times. The goal is to maximize the wait-time for each stop, avoiding situations where there is 
little time available to make the transfer. This is balanced with the generalized-cost. The cost
is adjusted with a new cost for wait-time (optimized-wait-time-cost).
              
The defaults should work fine, but if you have results with short wait-times dominating a better 
option or "back-travel", then try to increase the `minSafeWaitTimeFactor`, 
`backTravelWaitTimeFactor` and/or `extraStopBoardAlightCostsFactor`.
