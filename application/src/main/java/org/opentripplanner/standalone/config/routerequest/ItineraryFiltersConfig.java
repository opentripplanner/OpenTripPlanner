The purpose of the itinerary filter chain is to post process the result returned by the routing
search. The filters may modify itineraries, sort them, and filter away less preferable results.
        
OTP2 may produce numerous _pareto-optimal_ results when using `time`, `number-of-transfers` and
`generalized-cost` as criteria. Use the parameters listed here to reduce/filter the itineraries
return by the search engine before returning the results to client. There is also a few mandatory
non-configurable filters removing none optimal results. You may see these filters pop-up in the
filter debugging.

#### Group by similarity filters

The group-by-filter is a bit complex, but should be simple to use. Set `debug=true` and experiment
with `searchWindow` and the three group-by parameters(`groupSimilarityKeepOne`,
`groupSimilarityKeepThree` and `groupedOtherThanSameLegsMaxCostMultiplier`).

The group-by-filter work by grouping itineraries together and then reducing the number of
itineraries in each group, keeping the itinerary/itineraries with the best itinerary
_generalized-cost_. The group-by function first pick all transit legs that account for more than N%
of the itinerary based on distance traveled. This become the group-key. Two keys are the same if all
legs in one of the keys also exist in the other. Note, one key may have a larger set of legs than the
other, but they can still be the same. When comparing two legs we compare the `tripId` and make sure
the legs overlap in place and time. Two legs are the same if both legs ride at least a common
subsection of the same trip. The `keepOne` filter will keep ONE itinerary in each group. The
`keepThree` keeps 3 itineraries for each group.

The grouped itineraries can be further reduced by using `groupedOtherThanSameLegsMaxCostMultiplier`.
This parameter filters out itineraries, where the legs that are not common for all the grouped
itineraries have a much higher cost, than the lowest in the group. By default, it filters out
itineraries that are at least double in cost for the non-grouped legs.
