/**
 * Threadsafe mechanism for tracking any TripPatterns added to the graph via SIRI realtime messages.
 * This tracks only patterns added by realtime messages, not ones that already existed from the
 * scheduled NeTEx. This is a "cache" in the sense that it will keep returning the same TripPattern
 * when presented with the same StopPattern, so if realtime messages add many trips passing through
 * the same sequence of stops, they will all end up on this same TripPattern.
 * <p>
 * Note that there are two versions of this class, this one for GTFS-RT and another for SIRI.
 * See additional comments in the Javadoc of the GTFS-RT version of this class, whose name is
 * simply TripPatternCache.
 * TODO RT_AB: To the extent that double SIRI/GTFS implementations are kept, prefix all names
 *             with GTFS or SIRI or NETEX rather than having no prefix on the GTFS versions.
 *  TODO RT_TG: There is no clear strategy for what should be in the cache and the transit model and the flow
 *             between them. The NeTEx and a GTFS version of this should be merged. Having NeTex and GTFS
 *             specific indexes inside is ok. With the increased usage of DatedServiceJourneys, this should probably
 *             be part of the main model - not a separate cashe. It is possible that this class works when it comes to
 *             the thread-safety, but just by looking at a few lines of code I see problems - a strategy needs to be
 *             analysed, designed and documented.
