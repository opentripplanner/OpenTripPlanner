/**
 * Threadsafe mechanism for tracking any TripPatterns added to the graph via GTFS realtime messages.
 * This tracks only patterns added by realtime messages, not ones that already existed from the
 * scheduled GTFS. This is a "cache" in the sense that it will keep returning the same TripPattern
 * when presented with the same StopPattern, so if realtime messages add many trips passing through
 * the same sequence of stops, they will all end up on this same TripPattern.
 * <p>
 * Note that there are two versions of this class, this one for GTFS-RT and another for SIRI.
 * TODO RT_AB: consolidate TripPatternCache and SiriTripPatternCache. They seem to only be separate
 *    because SIRI- or GTFS-specific indexes of the added TripPatterns seem to have been added to
 *    this primary collection.
 * FIXME RT_AB: the name does not make it clear that this has anything to do with elements that are
 *    only added due to realtime updates, and it is only loosely a cache. RealtimeAddedTripPatterns?
