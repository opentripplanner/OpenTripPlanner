/**
 * This class keeps track which graph vertices have been visited and their associated states, so
 * that decisions can be made about whether new states should be enqueued for later exploration. It
 * also allows states to be retrieved for a given target vertex.
 * <p>
 * We no longer have different implementations of ShortestPathTree because the label-setting
 * (multi-state) approach used in turn restrictions, bike rental, etc. is a generalization of the
 * basic Dijkstra (single-state) approach. It is much more straightforward to use the more general
 * SPT implementation in all cases.
 * <p>
 * TODO: Is this still accurate?
 * Note that turn restrictions make all searches multi-state; however turn restrictions do not apply
 * when walking. The turn restriction handling is done in the base dominance function
 * implementation, and applies to all subclasses. It essentially splits each vertex into N vertices
 * depending on the incoming edge being taken.

   * Many shortest path algorithms will decrease the key of a vertex in the priority queue when it

   * updated or change their weight.
   * TODO consider just removing states from the priority queue.

   * When the Fibonacci heap was replaced with a binary heap, the decrease-key operation was
   * removed for the same reason: both improve theoretical run time complexity, at the cost of
   * high constant factors and more complex code.
