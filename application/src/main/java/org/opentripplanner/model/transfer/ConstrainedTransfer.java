   * Specificity of a transfer
   * </a>
   * <p>
   * The ranking implemented here is slightly modified:
   * <ul>
   *     <li>
   *         The specification do not say anything about Stations even if Stations can be used to
   *         specify a transfer-point. In OTP stops are more specific than station, so we use the
   *         following transfer-point ranking:
   *         <ol>
   *             <li>Station: 0 (zero)</li>
   *             <li>Stop: 1</li>
   *             <li>Route: 2</li>
   *             <li>Trip: 3</li>
   *         </ol>
   *     </li>
   *     <li>
   *         Two transfers may have the same ranking if we add together the from-point and
   *         to-point ranking.
   *         For example, {@code from trip(3) + to stop(1) == from route(2) + to route(2)}
   *         have the same ranking. To avoid this problem, we give the from-point a small
   *         advantage. We multiply the from point with 11 and the to point with 10, this
   *         break the ties in favor of the from point. In the example above the
   *         ConstrainedTransfer specificityRanking is:
   * <pre>
   * Case 1: from trip to stop :=  11 * 3 + 10 * 1 = 43
   * Case 2: from route to route :=  11 * 2 + 10 * 2 = 42
   * </pre>
   *         Case 1 has the highest ranking.
   *     </li>
   * </ul>
