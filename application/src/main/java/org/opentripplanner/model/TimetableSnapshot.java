/**
 * A TimetableSnapshot holds a set of realtime-updated Timetables frozen at a moment in time. It
 * can return a Timetable for any TripPattern in the public transit network considering all
 * accumulated realtime updates, falling back on the scheduled Timetable if no updates have been
 * applied for a given TripPattern.
 * <p>
 * This is a central part of managing concurrency when many routing searches may be happening, but
 * realtime updates are also streaming in which change the vehicle arrival and departure times.
 * Any given request will only see one unchanging TimetableSnapshot over the course of its search.
 * <p>
 * An instance of TimetableSnapshot first serves as a buffer to accumulate a batch of incoming
 * updates on top of any already known updates to the base schedules. From time to time such a batch
 * of updates is committed (like a database transaction). At this point the TimetableSnapshot is
 * treated as immutable and becomes available for use by new incoming routing requests.
 * <p>
 * All updates to a snapshot must be completed before it is handed off to any searches. A single
 * snapshot should be used for an entire search, and should remain unchanged for that duration to
 * provide a consistent view not only of trips that have been boarded, but of relative arrival and
 * departure times of other trips that have not necessarily been boarded.
 * <p>
 * A TimetableSnapshot instance may only be modified by a single thread. This makes it easier to
 * reason about how the snapshot is built up and used. Write operations are applied one by one, in
 * order, with no concurrent access. Read operations are then allowed concurrently by many threads
 * after writing is forbidden.
 * <p>
 * The fact that TripPattern instances carry a reference only to their scheduled Timetable and not
 * to their realtime timetable is largely due to historical path-dependence in OTP development.
 * Streaming realtime support was added around 2013 as a sort of sandbox feature that was switched
 * off by default. Looking up realtime timetables during routing was a fringe feature that needed
 * to impose near-zero cost and avoid introducing complexity into the primary codebase. Now over
 * ten years later, the principles of how this system operates are rather stable, but the
 * implementation would benefit from some deduplication and cleanup. Once that is complete, looking
 * up timetables on this class could conceivably be replaced with snapshotting entire views of the
 * transit network. It would also be possible to make the realtime version of Timetables or
 * TripTimes the primary view, and include references back to their scheduled versions.
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: when a snapshot is committed, the mutable state of this class is stored
 * in final fields and completely initialized in the constructor. This provides an additional
 * guarantee of safe-publication without synchronization.
 * (see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.5">final Field Semantics</a>)
