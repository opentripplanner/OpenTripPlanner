 * The purpose of the TripScheduleSearch is to search for a trip schedule for a given pattern.
 * The search need to be optimized for speed, this is one of the most frequently called
 * operations in Raptor and accessing objects in memory should be avoided.
 * <p/>
 * There should be two implementations of this interface, one for board-times and one for
 * alight-times. When Raptor search in reverse direction the alight-time search should be used. For
 * a reverse search (searching backward in time) the trip found departure/arrival times are swapped.
 * This is one of the things that allows for the Raptor implementation to be generic, used in both
 * cases.
