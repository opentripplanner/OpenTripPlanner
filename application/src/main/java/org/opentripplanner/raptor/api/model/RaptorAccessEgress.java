   * Raptor can add an optional time-penalty to a access/egress to make it less favourable compared
   * with other access/egress/transit options (paths). The penalty is a virtual extra duration of
   * time added inside Raptor when comparing time. The penalty does not propagate the c1 or c2 cost
   * values. This feature is useful when you want to limit the access/egress and the access/egress
   * is FASTER than the preferred option.
   * <p>
   * For example, for Park&Ride, driving all the way to the
   * destination is very often the best option when looking at the time criteria. When an
   * increasing time-penalty is applied to a car access/egress, then driving become less
   * favorable. This also improves performance, since we usually add a very high cost to
   * driving - making all park&ride access legs optimal - forcing Raptor to compute a path for
   * every option. The short drives are optimal on cost, and the long are optimal on time. In the
   * case of park&ride the time-penalty enables Raptor to choose one of the shortest access/egress
   * paths over the longer ones.
   * <p>
   * Another example is FLEX, where we in many use-cases want regular transit to win if there is
   * an offer. Only in the case where the FLEX is the only solution we want it to be presented.
   * To achieve this, we must add an extra duration to the time of the FLEX access/egress - it does
   * not help to just add extra cost - which makes both FLEX optimal on time and transit optimal on
   * cost. Keeping a large number of optimal access paths has a negative impact on performance as well.

   * The unit is seconds and the default value is {@link RaptorConstants#TIME_NOT_SET}.

   * of the criteria used to keep an optimal result.
   * <p>
   * Note! The number returned should include all "rides" in the access leg resulting in an extra
   * transfer, including boarding the first Raptor scheduled trip. There is no need to account for
   * riding your own bicycle or scooter, and a rental bike is debatable. The guideline is that if

   * rental-bicycle |      0       | Picking up the bike and returning it is is best
   *                |              | accounted using time and cost penalties, not transfers.
   *     taxi       |     0/1      | Currently 0 in OTP(car), but this is definitely discussable.
   *     flex       |      1       | Walking leg followed by a flex transit leg
   * walk-flex-walk |      1       | Walking , then flex transit and then walking again
