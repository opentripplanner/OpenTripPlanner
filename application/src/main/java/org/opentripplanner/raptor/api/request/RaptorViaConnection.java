/**
 * A via-connection is used to define one of the physical locations in a via location Raptor must
 * visit. At least one connection in a {@link RaptorViaLocation} must be used. A connection can be
 * a single stop or a stop and a transfer to another stop. The last is useful if you want to use
 * the connection to visit something other than a stop, like a street location.
 * This is not an alternative to transfers. Raptor supports several use-cases
 * through via-connections:
 *
 * <h4>Route via a pass-through-stop</h4>
 * Raptor will allow a path to go through a pass-through-stop. The stop can be visited on-board
 * transit, or at the alight- or board-stop. The from-stop and to-stop must be the same, and the
 * minimum-wait-time must be zero.
 *
 * <h4>Route via a single stop with a minimum-wait-time</h4>
 * Raptor will allow a path to go through a single stop, if the from-stop and to-stop is the
 * same. If the minimum-wait-time is greater than zero(0) the path will either alight or board
 * transit at this stop, and the minimum-wait-time criteria is enforced.
 *
 * <h4>Route via a coordinate</h4>
 *
 * To route through a coordinate you need to find all nearby stops, then find all access and egress
 * paths to and from the street location. Then combine all access and egress paths to form
 * complete transfers. Raptor does not know/see the actual via street location, it only uses the
 * connection from a stop to another, the total time it takes and the total cost. You must generate
 * a transfer with two "legs" in it. One leg going from the 'from-stop' to the street location, and
 * one leg going back to the 'to-stop'. If you have 10 stops around the via street location, then
 * you must combine all ten access paths and egress paths.
 *
 * The min-wait-time in the {@link RaptorViaLocation} is added to the transfers
 * {@code durationInSeconds}. The calculation of {@code c1} should include the walk time, but not
 * the min-wait-time (assuming all connections have the same minimum wait time).
