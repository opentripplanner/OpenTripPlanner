    The length of the search-window in seconds. This parameter is optional.
        
    The search-window is defined as the duration between the earliest-departure-time(EDT) and
    the latest-departure-time(LDT). OTP will search for all itineraries in this departure
    window. If `arriveBy=true` the `dateTime` parameter is the latest-arrival-time, so OTP
    will dynamically calculate the EDT. Using a short search-window is faster than using a
    longer one, but the search duration is not linear. Using a \"too\" short search-window will
    waste resources server side, while using a search-window that is too long will be slow.
        
    OTP will dynamically calculate a reasonable value for the search-window, if not provided.
    The calculation comes with a significant overhead (10-20% extra). Whether you should use the
    dynamic calculated value or pass in a value depends on your use-case. For a travel planner
    in a small geographical area, with a dense network of public transportation, a fixed value
    between 40 minutes and 2 hours makes sense. To find the appropriate search-window, adjust
    it so that the number of itineraries on average is around the wanted `numItineraries`. Make
    sure you set the `numItineraries` to a high number while testing. For a country wide area
    like Norway, using the dynamic search-window is the best.
        
    When paginating, the search-window is calculated using the `numItineraries` in the original
    search together with statistics from the search for the last page. This behaviour is
    configured server side, and can not be overridden from the client.
