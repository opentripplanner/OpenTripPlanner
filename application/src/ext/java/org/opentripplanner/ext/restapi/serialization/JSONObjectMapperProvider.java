/**
 * AgencyAndId is a third-party class in One Bus Away which represents a GTFS element's ID,
 * including an agency name as identifier scope information since more than one feed may be loaded
 * at once.
 * <p>
 * While this works when there is only one agency per feed, the true scope of identifiers is the
 * feed, and the same agency could appear in multiple feeds. We don't want the key "agencyId" to
 * appear in the final OTP API because it will eventually not represent an agency.
 * <p>
 * See this ticket: https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/1352
 * <p>
 * And this proposal to gtfs-changes: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gtfs-changes/zVjEoNIPr_Y/4ngWCajPoS0J
 * <p>
 * Our solution is to serialize the FeedScopedId as a single string with a separator character
 * between the agency and ID. In future versions this scoped identifier will actually represent a
 * feed and ID. The important thing is that the API will remain the same, and identifiers fetched
 * from one API result can be used in another request with no conflicts.
 * <p>
 * TODO - This is no longer the case - the FeedScopedId can be annotated.
 * Since FeedScopedId is a third-party class, we can't modify it with a custom serialization method
 * or annotations. Instead, we have to let Jackson know which custom serializer class applies to the
 * third-party type. According to http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHowToCustomSerializers "Jackson
 * 1.7 added ability to register serializers and deserializes via Module interface. This is the
 * recommended way to add custom serializers."
 * <p>
 * A Jackson "Module" is a group of extensions to default functionality, used for example to support
 * serializing new data types. Modules are registered with an ObjectMapper, which constructs
 * ObjectWriters, which are used to do the final JSON writing. In OTP the ObjectWriter construction
 * and JSON writing are performed automatically by Jersey.
