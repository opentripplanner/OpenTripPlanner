## PR Instructions
When creating a pull request, please follow the format below. For each section, *replace* the guidance text with your own text, keeping the section heading. If you have nothing to say in a particular section, you can completely delete the section including its heading to indicate that you have taken the requested steps. None of these instructions or the guidance text (non-heading text) should be present in the submitted PR. These sections serve as a checklist: when you have replaced or deleted all of them, the PR is considered complete. As of 2021, most regular OTP contributors participate in our twice-weekly conference calls. For all but the simplest and smallest PRs, participation in these discussions is necessary to facilitate the review and merge process. Other developers can ask questions and provide immediate feedback on technical design and code style, and resolve any concerns about long term maintenance and comprehension of new code.

### Summary
Explain in one or two sentences what this PR achieves. 

### Issue
Link to or create an [issue](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues) that describes the relevant feature or bug. 
You need not create an issue for small bugfixes and code cleanups, but in that case do describe the problem clearly and completely in the "summary" section above.
In the linked issue (or summary section for smaller PRs) please describe:
- Motivation (problem or need encountered)
- How the code works
- Technical approach and any design considerations or decisions

Remember that the PR will be reviewed by another developer who may not be familiar with your use cases or the code you're modifying. It generally takes much less effort for the author of a PR to explain the background and technical details than for a reviewer to infer or deduce them. PRs may be closed if they or their linked issues do not contain sufficient information for a reviewer to proceed.

Add [GitHub keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) to this PR's description, for example:
