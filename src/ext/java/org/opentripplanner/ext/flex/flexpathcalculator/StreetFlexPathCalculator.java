/**
 * StreetFlexPathCalculator calculates the driving times and distances based on the street network
 * using the AStar algorithm.
 *
 * Note that it caches the whole ShortestPathTree the first time it encounters a new fromVertex.
 * Subsequent requests from the same fromVertex can fetch the path to the toVertex from the
 * existing ShortestPathTree. This one-to-many approach is needed to make the performance acceptable.
 *
 * Because we will have lots of searches with the same origin when doing access searches and a lot
 * of searches with the same destination when doing egress searches, the calculator needs to be
 * configured so that the caching is done with either the origin or destination vertex as the key.
 * The one-to-many search will then either be done in the forward or the reverse direction depending
 * on this configuration.
