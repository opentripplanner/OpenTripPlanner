/**
 * This is a white-list of supported parameters. The purpose is to standardize the parameter names
 * and allow API users/client applications to implement support for this across deployments.
 * <p>
 * There are two types of each parameter, a penalty and a threshold. So, you will not find
 * {@code ozone} on the API or in config. Instead there will be the two types, {@code ozone_} and
 * {@code ozone_}.
 * <p>
 * If the parameter you need is not listed, you can ask for  it  to be added. Make a PR or issue,
 * or contact the community.
