# Module tests

This package contains functional tests for the Raptor module(`RaptorService`) as a black box. Each 
test class should focus on testing ONE feature or scenario. Each test class should contain a small
test data set made with the _feature-under-test_ in mind. This make the tests focused, small and 
easier to maintain. 

Each test class should document the _feature-under-test_ in the class java-doc.

Each test has a prefix `A01`.. `Z99` to group similar test using the prefix `A`..`Z` and sort each
group from simple to complex tests (`01` to `99`).
