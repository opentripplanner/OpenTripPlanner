/**
 * The purpose of the TripScheduleBoardAlight is to represent the board/alight for a
 * given trip at a specific stop. This is used as a result for the trip search, but may also
 * be used in other situation where a search is unnecessary like a guaranteed transfer.
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class is passed on to the algorithm to perform the boarding and contain the
 * necessary information to do so.
 * <p>
 * The instance can represent both the result of a forward search and the result of a reverse
 * search. For a reverse search (searching backward in time) the trip arrival times should be
 * used. This is one of the things that allows for the algorithm to be generic, used
 * in both cases.
