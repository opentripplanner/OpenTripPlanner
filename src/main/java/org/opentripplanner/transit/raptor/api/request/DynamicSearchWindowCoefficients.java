/**
 * The dynamic search window coefficients is used to calculate EDT(earliest-departure-time),
 * LAT(latest-arrival-time) and SW(raptor-search-window) request parameters using heuristics.
 * The heuristics perform a Raptor search (one-iteration) to find a trip witch we use to find a
 * lower bound for the travel duration time - the "minTransitTime". The heuristic search is used
 * for other purposes too, and is very fast.
 * <p>
 * At least the EDT or the LAT must be passed into Raptor to perform a Range Raptor search. If
 * unknown/missing the parameters(EDT, LAT, DW) is dynamically calculated. The dynamic coefficients
 * affect the performance and should be tuned to match the deployment.
 * <p>
 * The request parameters are calculated like this:
 * <pre>
 *     DW  = round_N(C + T * minTransitTime + W * minWaitTime)
 *     LAT = EDT + DW + minTransitTime
 *     EDT = LAT - (DW + minTransitTime)
 * </pre>
 * The {@code round_N(...)} method is will round the input to the closest multiplication of N.
 * <p>
 * The 3 coefficients above are:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@code C} - {@link #minWinTimeMinutes()}</li>
 *     <li>{@code T} - {@link #minTransitTimeCoefficient()}</li>
 *     <li>{@code W} - {@link #minWaitTimeCoefficient()}</li>
 *     <li>{@code N} - {@link #stepMinutes()}</li>
 * </ol>
 * In addition the this an upper bound on the calculation of the search window:
 * {@link #maxWinTimeMinutes()}.
