/**
 * The transit calculator is used to calculate transit related stuff, like calculating
 * <em>earliest boarding time</em> and time-shifting the access paths.
 * <p/>
 * The calculator is shared between the state, worker and path mapping code. This make the
 * calculations consistent and let us hide the request parameters. Hiding the request parameters
 * ensure that this calculator is used.
 * <p>
 * There is one calculator for FORWARD search and one for REVERSE search. The documentation and
 * argument names uses a search-direction agnostic vocabulary. We try to use the terms "source" and
 * "target", in stead of "from/to" and "board/alight".
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *     In a FORWARD search the "source" means "from" and "TARGET" means "to".
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     In a BACKWARD search the "source" means "to" and "TARGET" means "from". The traversal of the
 *     graph happens from the destination towards the origin - backwards in time. The "from/to"
 *     refer to the "natural way" we think about a journey, while "source/target" the destination
 *     is the source and the origin is the target in a BACKWARD search.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * "Source" and "target" may apply to stop-arrival, trip, board-/aligh-slack, and so on.
 * <p>
 * For a BACKWORD search the "source" means "from" (stop-arrival, trip, and so on).
 *
 * @param <T> The TripSchedule type defined by the user of the raptor API.
