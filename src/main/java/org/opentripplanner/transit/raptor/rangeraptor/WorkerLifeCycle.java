/**
 * The class is responsible for registration of Range Raptor Worker life cycle event listeners.
 * The listeners add them self to this class an receive a callbacks on the subscribed event.
 * The listener is notified when thise Range Raptor events occur:
 * <ol>
 *     <li><b>setupIteration</b> with iteration departureTime</li>
 *     <li><b>prepareForNextRound</b></li>
 *     <li><b>transitsForRoundComplete</b></li>
 *     <li><b>transfersForRoundComplete</b></li>
 *     <li><b>roundComplete</b> with flag to indicate if the destination is reached</li>
 *     <li><b>iterationComplete</b></li>
 * </ol>
 * By providing the ability to subscribe to such events each class can decide
 * independently of its relations to subscribe. For example can the DestinationArrivals
 * class subscribe to any events, without relying on its parent (WorkerState)
 * to delegate these events down the relationship three. This decouples the
 * code.
