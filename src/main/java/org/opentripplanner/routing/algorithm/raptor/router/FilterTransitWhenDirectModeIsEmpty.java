/**
 * <p>
 * In OTP the street search and transit search is done as to separate searches. The results is then
 * merged and filtered to remove none optimal itineraries. But, when the client do NOT provide
 * a ´directMode´, OTP do not do the streetSearch. And, the removal of none optimal results is not
 * done, there is not street results to use to prune bad transit results with. In other words OTP
 * is forced to return at least one itinerary with at least one transit leg. So, instead of walking
 * maybe 100 meters, the OTP suggest you need to walk to the closest buss stop, take the bus one
 * stop and walk back, oten with more walking than just those 100 meters.
 * <p>
 * <b>Let say OTP produces these internal results:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Itinerary-1: {@code Origin ~ Walk 100m ~ Destination} (Street search)</li>
 *   <li>Itinerary-2: {@code Origin ~ Walk 120m ~ Stop A ~ Bus 10:00 10:05 ~ Stop B ~ Walk 200m ~ Destination} (Raptor search)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>API level results</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Request 1: {@code directMode:WALK, access/egressMode: WALK, transitModes:[TRANSIT] }, OTP returns [ Itinerary-1 ]</li>
 *   <li>Request 2: {@code directMode:null, access/egressMode: WALK, transitModes:[TRANSIT] }, OTP returns [ Itinerary-2 ]</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In this case Itinerary-1 is clearly better than Itinerary-2. Some OTP clients run a separate
 * searches for WALK-ALL-THE_WAY, BIKE-ALL-THE-WAY, and WALK+TRANSIT. In this case, it would be
 * best for if Request 2 above return an empty set, not the silly Itinerary-2.
 * <p>
 * If no directMode is set, the responsibility of this class it to always filter away itineraries
 * with a generalized-cost that is higher than the WALK-ALL-THE-WAY. We achieve this by setting the
 * directMode before searching. This trigger the direct street search, and later the result is
 * passed into the filter chain where none optimal results are removed. Finally the street itinerary
 * is removed and the request street mode rest to the original state.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why do we use generalized-cost, and not walk distance or a full pareto comparison?</b>
 * <p>
 * In general we assume that walking can be time-shifted; hence we can exclude arrival and
 * departure time from the "pareto" comparison. The transit might have a higher cost and shorter
 * travel time than the walk-all-the-way itinerary, but this is theoretical and I have not managed
 * to construct a good transit alternative.
 * <p>
 * If we compare itineraries by walking distance(not cost), we would still get silly results. E.g.
 * if the only stop reachable within walking distance is a train station, we could get a itinerary
 * like this:
 * <p>
 * {@code Origin ~ Walk 50m ~ Stop 1a ~ Train 10:00 10:15 ~ Stop B ~ Train 10:20 10:35 ~ Stop 1d ~
 * Walk 50m ~ Destination }
 * NOT: {@code Origin ~ Walk 120m ~ Destination }
