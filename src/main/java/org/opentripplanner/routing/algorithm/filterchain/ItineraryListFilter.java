 * Filter, sort or decorate itineraries. A filter can modify the elements in the list, but not the
 * List. It should treat the list as immutable. Do not change the list passed into the filter,
 * insteadã€€make a copy, change it and return the copy. It is allowed to return the list unchanged.
 * <p>
 * A filter should do only one thing! For example do not change the itineraries and delete elements
 * in the same filter. Instead, create two filters and insert them after each other in the filter
 * chain.
 * <p>
 * This allows decoration of each filter and make it easier to reuse logic. Like the
 * {@link org.opentripplanner.routing.algorithm.filterchain.deletionflagger.MaxLimitFilter} is reused in
