/**
 * This class contains the logic for repeatedly building shortest path trees and accumulating paths through
 * the graph until the requested number of them have been found.
 * It is used in point-to-point (i.e. not one-to-many / analyst) routing.
 *
 * Its exact behavior will depend on whether the routing request allows transit.
 *
 * When using transit it will incorporate techniques from what we called "long distance" mode,
 * which is designed to provide reasonable response times when routing over large graphs (e.g.
 * the entire Netherlands or New York State). In this case it only uses the street network at the
 * first and last legs of the trip, and all other transfers between transit vehicles will occur
 * via PathTransfer edges which are pre-computed by the graph builder.
 * 
 * More information is available on the OTP wiki at:
 * https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/LargeGraphs
 *
 * One instance of this class should be constructed per search (i.e. per RoutingRequest: it is request-scoped).
 * Its behavior is undefined if it is reused for more than one search.
 *
 * It is very close to being an abstract library class with only static functions. However it turns out to be convenient
 * and harmless to have the OTPServer object etc. in fields, to avoid passing context around in function parameters.
