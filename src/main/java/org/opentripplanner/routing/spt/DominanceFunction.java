/**
 * A class that determines when one search branch prunes another at the same Vertex, and ultimately which solutions
 * are retained. In the general case, one branch does not necessarily win out over the other, i.e. multiple states can
 * coexist at a single Vertex.
 * 
 * Even functions where one state always wins (least weight, fastest travel time) are applied within a multi-state
 * shortest path tree because bike rental, car or bike parking, and turn restrictions all require multiple incomparable 
 * states at the same vertex. These need the graph to be "replicated" into separate layers, which is achieved by 
 * applying the main dominance logic (lowest weight, lowest cost, Pareto) conditionally, only when the two states
 * have identical bike/car/turn direction status.
 * 
 * Dominance functions are serializable so that routing requests may passed between machines in different JVMs, for instance
 * in OTPA Cluster.

         *
         * We used to allow also loops for bicycles as turn restrictions also apply to them, however
         * this causes problems when the start/destination is close to an area that has a very complex
         * network of edges due to the visibility calculation. In such a case it can lead to timeouts as
         * too many loops are produced.
         *
         * Example: https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/3564
         *
         * In any case, cyclists can always get off the bike and push it across the street so not
         * including the loops should still result in a route. Often this will be preferable to
         * taking a detour due to turn restrictions anyway.
