/**
 * This class keeps track which graph vertices have been visited and their associated states,
 * so that decisions can be made about whether new states should be enqueued for later exploration.
 * It also allows states to be retrieved for a given target vertex.
 * 
 * We no longer have different implementations of ShortestPathTree because the label-setting (multi-state) approach
 * used in public transit routing, turn restrictions, bike rental, etc. is a generalization of the basic Dijkstra 
 * (single-state) approach. It is much more straightforward to use the more general SPT implementation in all cases.
 *
 * Note that turn restrictions make all searches multi-state; however turn restrictions do not apply when walking.
 * The turn restriction handling is done in the base dominance function implementation, and applies to all subclasses.
 * It essentially splits each vertex into N vertices depending on the incoming edge being taken.

     * high constant factors and more complex code.
