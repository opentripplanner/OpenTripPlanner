/**
 * This class represents what is called a JourneyPattern in Transmodel: the sequence of stops at
 * which a trip (GTFS) or vehicle journey (Transmodel) calls, irrespective of the day on which 
 * service runs.
 * 
 * An important detail: Routes in GTFS are not a structurally important element, they just serve as
 * user-facing information. It is possible for the same journey pattern to appear in more than one
 * route. 
 * 
 * OTP already has several classes that represent this same thing: A TripPattern in the context of
 * routing. It represents all trips with the same stop pattern A ScheduledStopPattern in the GTFS
 * loading process. A RouteVariant in the TransitIndex, which has a unique human-readable name and
 * belongs to a particular route.
 * 
 * We would like to combine all these different classes into one.
 * 
 * Any two trips with the same stops in the same order, and that operate on the same days, can be
 * combined using a TripPattern to simplify the graph. This saves memory and reduces search
 * complexity since we only consider the trip that departs soonest for each pattern. Field
 * calendarId has been removed. See issue #1320.
 * 
 * A StopPattern is very closely related to a TripPattern -- it essentially serves as the unique
 * key for a TripPattern. Should the route be included in the StopPattern?
