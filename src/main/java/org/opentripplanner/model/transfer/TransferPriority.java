 * Prioritize transfers between to trips. The priority goes from the lowest value NOT_ALLOWED to

 * GTFS the priority is mapped using {@code transfer_type}:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *         {@code 0 or empty -> PREFERRED}. Recommended transfer point between routes.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@code 1 -> ALLOWED}. Timed transfer point between two routes. The departing vehicle is
 *         expected to wait for the arriving one and leave sufficient time for a rider to transfer
 *         between routes. The transfer is also set as GUARANTEED.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@code 3 -> NOT_ALLOWED}. Transfers are not possible
 *     /li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Note that for {@code transfer_type=1} the guarantied flag is also set causing it to take
 * precedence over the priority. A guarantied ALLOWED transfer is preferred over a PREFERRED
 * none-guarantied transfer.
 * <p>
 * Note that {@code transfer_type=2} is not a constraint, just a regular path transfer.
