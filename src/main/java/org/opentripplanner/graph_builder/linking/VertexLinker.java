/**
 * This class links transit stops to streets by splitting the streets (unless the stop is extremely
 * close to the street intersection).
 * <p>
 * It is intended to eventually completely replace the existing stop linking code, which had been
 * through so many revisions and adaptations to different street and turn representations that it
 * was very glitchy. This new code is also intended to be deterministic in linking to streets,
 * independent of the order in which the JVM decides to iterate over Maps and even in the presence
 * of points that are exactly halfway between multiple candidate linking points.
 * <p>
 * It would be wise to keep this new incarnation of the linking code relatively simple, considering
 * what happened before.
 * <p>
 * See discussion in pull request #1922, follow up issue #1934, and the original issue calling for
 * replacement of the stop linker, #1305.
