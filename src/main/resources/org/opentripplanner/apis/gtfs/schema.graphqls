        The length of the search-window in seconds. This parameter is optional.

        The search-window is defined as the duration between the earliest-departure-time(EDT) and
        the latest-departure-time(LDT). OTP will search for all itineraries in this departure
        window. If `arriveBy=true` the `dateTime` parameter is the latest-arrival-time, so OTP
        will dynamically calculate the EDT. Using a short search-window is faster than using a
        longer one, but the search duration is not linear. Using a \"too\" short search-window will
        waste resources server side, while using a search-window that is too long will be slow.

        OTP will dynamically calculate a reasonable value for the search-window, if not provided.
        The calculation comes with a significant overhead (10-20% extra). Whether you should use the
        dynamic calculated value or pass in a value depends on your use-case. For a travel planner
        in a small geographical area, with a dense network of public transportation, a fixed value
        between 40 minutes and 2 hours makes sense. To find the appropriate search-window, adjust
        it so that the number of itineraries on average is around the wanted `numItineraries`. Make
        sure you set the `numItineraries` to a high number while testing. For a country wide area
        like Norway, using the dynamic search-window is the best.

        When paginating, the search-window is calculated using the `numItineraries` in the original
        search together with statistics from the search for the last page. This behaviour is
        configured server side, and can not be overridden from the client.
