# Project Governance

OpenTripPlanner is a member project of the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/members/current/). Development of OpenTripPlanner is managed by a steering committee which makes decisions by simple majority vote. The current members of this steering committee are (in alphabetical order): Andrew Byrd, Matthew Conway, David Emory, Avi Flamholz, Laurent Grégoire, Frank Purcell, David Turner, and Łukasz Witkowski.

Beginning with the 1.0 release of OpenTripPlanner, the steering committee will hold a quarterly video conference on the first Thursday of June, September, December, and March. An agenda should be prepared as a collaborative document in advance of each quarterly meeting. These meetings will be held at 9AM US Pacific time because we have members in the US Pacific, US Eastern, and Central European time zones.

Care should be taken to avoid governance system that is too conceptual or process-heavy. The main goal is to have regular agenda-driven meetings that yield clear decisions and action items assigned to specific people. The committee should ideally be composed of active, professional contributors to the OpenTripPlanner project, including representatives of organizations that host official public deployments of OTP.
