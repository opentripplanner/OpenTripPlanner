# Project Governance

OpenTripPlanner is a member project of
the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/members/current/). Development of
OpenTripPlanner is managed by a Project Leadership Committee (PLC) which makes decisions by simple
majority vote. The current members of this committee are (in alphabetical order):

The PLC holds a quarterly video conference on the first Tuesday of June, September, December, and
March. An agenda is prepared as a collaborative document in advance of each quarterly meeting. These
meetings are held at 8AM US Pacific time to accommodate members in the US Pacific, US Eastern, and
Central European time zones.

We take care to avoid a governance system that is too conceptual or process-heavy. The main goal is
to have regular agenda-driven meetings that yield clear decisions and action items assigned to
specific people. The committee should ideally be composed of active, professional contributors to
the OpenTripPlanner project, including representatives of organizations that host official public
deployments of OTP.

We enfore a policy on the review and merging of new changes to the OTP system, guided by a roadmap
maintained by the committee. All changes must be reviewed and approved by at least two people from
two different organizations. The list of approved reviewers is the PLC Github group, visible
