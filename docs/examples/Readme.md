# Example configurations

When setting up OTP it is often useful to have some examples to look at. If you have an example to
share just add it here.

## Examples

| Name          | Organisation                 | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| entur         | Entur, Norway                | Deployment Configuration with NeTEX input data                              |
| ibi           | IBI Group, USA               | Allow routing for wheelchair users even if accessibility data is incomplete |
| skanetrafiken | Skånetrafiken, Sweden, Skåne | Deployment Configuration with combination of NeTEx and GTFS input data      |

## Support

The examples are provided "as is" - they may get outdated over time or miss information, and it is
left to the provider, not the PLC, to include whatever the provider find useful.

## How to share an example

Anyone who want can add their example here as long as it is OTP "related". Just create a normal
pull-request to add it.
