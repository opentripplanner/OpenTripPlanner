<h3 id="rd_alightSlack">alightSlack</h3>

**Since version:** `2.0` ∙ **Type:** `duration` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `"PT0S"`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults 

The minimum extra time after exiting a public transport vehicle.

The slack is added to the time when going from the transit vehicle to the stop.

<h3 id="rd_bikeBoardCost">bikeBoardCost</h3>

**Since version:** `2.0` ∙ **Type:** `integer` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `600`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults 

Prevents unnecessary transfers by adding a cost for boarding a vehicle.

This is the cost that is used when boarding while cycling.This is usually higher that walkBoardCost.

<h3 id="rd_boardSlack">boardSlack</h3>

**Since version:** `2.0` ∙ **Type:** `duration` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `"PT0S"`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults 

The boardSlack is the minimum extra time to board a public transport vehicle.

The board time is added to the time when going from the stop (offboard) to onboard a transit
vehicle.

This is the same as the `minimumTransferTime`, except that this also apply to to the first
transit leg in the trip. This is the default value used, if not overridden by the `boardSlackList`.


<h3 id="rd_drivingDirection">drivingDirection</h3>

**Since version:** `2.2` ∙ **Type:** `enum` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `"right"`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults   
**Enum values:** `right` | `left`

The driving direction to use in the intersection traversal calculation

**Since version:** `2.2` ∙ **Type:** `enum` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `"simple"`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults   
**Enum values:** `norway` | `simple`

The model that computes the costs of turns.

<h3 id="rd_maxAccessEgressDuration">maxAccessEgressDuration</h3>

**Since version:** `2.1` ∙ **Type:** `duration` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `"PT45M"`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults 

This is the maximum duration for access/egress for street searches.

This is a performance limit and should therefore be set high. Results close to the limit are not
guaranteed to be optimal. Use itinerary-filters to limit what is presented to the client. The
duration can be set per mode(`maxAccessEgressDurationForMode`), because some street modes searches
are much more resource intensive than others. A default value is applied if the mode specific value
do not exist.

<h3 id="rd_maxJourneyDuration">maxJourneyDuration</h3>

**Since version:** `2.1` ∙ **Type:** `duration` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `"PT24H"`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults 

The expected maximum time a journey can last across all possible journeys for the current deployment.

Normally you would just do an estimate and add enough slack, so you are sure that there is no
journeys that falls outside this window. The parameter is used find all possible dates for the
journey and then search only the services which run on those dates. The duration must include
access, egress, wait-time and transit time for the whole journey. It should also take low frequency
days/periods like holidays into account. In other words, pick the two points within your area that
has the worst connection and then try to travel on the worst possible day, and find the maximum
journey duration. Using a value that is too high has the effect of including more patterns in the
search, hence, making it a bit slower. Recommended values would be from 12 hours(small town/city),
1 day (region) to 2 days (country like Norway)."


<h3 id="rd_optimize">optimize</h3>

Whether non-optimal transit paths at the destination should be returned

Let c be the existing minimum pareto optimal generalized cost to beat. Then a trip
with cost c' is accepted if the following is true:
`c' < Math.round(c * relaxRaptorCostCriteria)`.

The parameter is optional. If not set a normal comparison is performed.

Values equals or less than zero is not allowed. Values greater than 2.0 are not
supported, due to performance reasons.


<h3 id="rd_searchWindow">searchWindow</h3>

**Since version:** `2.0` ∙ **Type:** `duration` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults 

The duration of the search-window.

This is the time/duration in seconds from the earliest-departure-time(EDT) to the
latest-departure-time(LDT). In case of a reverse search it will be the time from earliest to
latest arrival time (LAT - EAT).

All optimal travels that depart within the search window is guarantied to be found.

This is sometimes referred to as the Range Raptor Search Window - but could be used in a none
Transit search as well; Hence this is named search-window and not raptor-search-window.

This is normally dynamically calculated by the server. Use `null` to unset, and *zero* to do one
Raptor iteration. The value is dynamically  assigned a suitable value, if not set. In a small to
medium size operation you may use a fixed value, like 60 minutes. If you have a mixture of high
frequency cities routes and  infrequent long distant journeys, the best option is normally to use
the dynamic auto assignment. If not provided the value is resolved depending on the other input
parameters, available transit options and realtime changes.

There is no need to set this when going to the next/previous page. The OTP Server will
increase/decrease the search-window when paging to match the requested number of itineraries.

**Path:** /routingDefaults 

A multiplier for how bad walking is, compared to being in transit for equal lengths of time.

Empirically, values between 2 and 4 seem to correspond well to the concept of not wanting to walk
too much without asking for totally ridiculous itineraries, but this observation should in no way
be taken as scientific or definitive. Your mileage may vary.
See https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/4090 for impact on performance with
high values.

<h3 id="rd_itineraryFilters">itineraryFilters</h3>

**Since version:** `2.0` ∙ **Type:** `object` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults 

Configure itinerary filters that may modify itineraries, sort them, and filter away less preferable results.

The purpose of the itinerary filter chain is to post process the result returned by the routing
search. The filters may modify itineraries, sort them, and filter away less preferable results.

OTP2 may produce numerous _pareto-optimal_ results when using `time`, `number-of-transfers` and
`generalized-cost` as criteria. Use the parameters listed here to reduce/filter the itineraries
return by the search engine before returning the results to client. There is also a few mandatory
non-configurable filters removing none optimal results. You may see these filters pop-up in the
filter debugging.

#### Group by similarity filters

The group-by-filter is a bit complex, but should be simple to use. Set `debug=true` and experiment
with `searchWindow` and the three group-by parameters(`groupSimilarityKeepOne`,
`groupSimilarityKeepThree` and `groupedOtherThanSameLegsMaxCostMultiplier`).

The group-by-filter work by grouping itineraries together and then reducing the number of
itineraries in each group, keeping the itinerary/itineraries with the best itinerary
_generalized-cost_. The group-by function first pick all transit legs that account for more than N%
of the itinerary based on distance traveled. This become the group-key. Two keys are the same if all
legs in one of the keys also exist in the other. Note, one key may have a larger set of legs than the
other, but they can still be the same. When comparing two legs we compare the `tripId` and make sure
the legs overlap in place and time. Two legs are the same if both legs ride at least a common
subsection of the same trip. The `keepOne` filter will keep ONE itinerary in each group. The
`keepThree` keeps 3 itineraries for each group.

The grouped itineraries can be further reduced by using `groupedOtherThanSameLegsMaxCostMultiplier`.
This parameter filters out itineraries, where the legs that are not common for all the grouped
itineraries have a much higher cost, than the lowest in the group. By default, it filters out
itineraries that are at least double in cost for the non-grouped legs.


<h3 id="rd_if_accessibilityScore">accessibilityScore</h3>

**Since version:** `2.2` ∙ **Type:** `boolean` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `false`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults/itineraryFilters 

An experimental feature contributed by IBI which adds a sandbox accessibility *score* between 0 and 1 for each leg and itinerary.

This can be used by frontend developers to implement a simple traffic light UI.

<h3 id="rd_if_bikeRentalDistanceRatio">bikeRentalDistanceRatio</h3>

**Since version:** `2.1` ∙ **Type:** `double` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `0.0`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults/itineraryFilters 

Filter routes that consist of bike-rental and walking by the minimum fraction of the bike-rental leg using _distance_.

This filters out results that consist of a long walk plus a relatively short bike rental leg. A
value of `0.3` means that a minimum of 30% of the total distance must be spent on the bike in order
for the result to be included.


<h3 id="rd_if_filterItinerariesWithSameFirstOrLastTrip">filterItinerariesWithSameFirstOrLastTrip</h3>

**Since version:** `2.2` ∙ **Type:** `boolean` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `false`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults/itineraryFilters 

If more than one itinerary begins or ends with same trip, filter out one of those itineraries so that only one remains.

Trips are considered equal if they have same id and same service day. Non-transit legs are skipped
during comparison. Before filtering, trips are sorted by their generalized cost. The algorithm loops
through the list from top to bottom. If an itinerary matches from any other itinerary from above, it is
removed from list.


<h3 id="rd_if_groupedOtherThanSameLegsMaxCostMultiplier">groupedOtherThanSameLegsMaxCostMultiplier</h3>

**Since version:** `2.1` ∙ **Type:** `double` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `2.0`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults/itineraryFilters 

Filter grouped itineraries, where the non-grouped legs are more expensive than in the lowest cost one.

Of the itineraries grouped to maximum of three itineraries, how much worse can the non-grouped legs
be compared to the lowest cost. 2.0 means that they can be double the cost, and any itineraries
having a higher cost will be filtered.


<h3 id="rd_if_minBikeParkingDistance">minBikeParkingDistance</h3>

**Since version:** `2.3` ∙ **Type:** `double` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `0.0`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults/itineraryFilters 

Filter out bike park+ride results that have fewer meters of cycling than this value.

Useful if you want to exclude those routes which have only a few meters of cycling before parking the bike and taking public transport.

<h3 id="rd_if_nonTransitGeneralizedCostLimit">nonTransitGeneralizedCostLimit</h3>

**Since version:** `2.1` ∙ **Type:** `linear-function` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `"f(x) = 3,600 + 2.0 x"`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults/itineraryFilters 

The function define a max-limit for generalized-cost for non-transit itineraries.

The max-limit is applied to itineraries with *no transit legs*, however *all* itineraries
(including those with transit legs) are considered when calculating the minimum cost. The smallest
generalized-cost value is used as input to the function. The function is used to calculate a
*max-limit*. The max-limit is then used to filter *non-transit* itineraries by
*generalized-cost*. Itineraries with a cost higher than the max-limit are dropped from the result
set.

For example if the function is `f(x) = 1800 + 2.0 x` and the smallest cost is `5000`, then all
non-transit itineraries with a cost larger than `1800 + 2 * 5000 = 11 800` are dropped.


<h3 id="rd_if_parkAndRideDurationRatio">parkAndRideDurationRatio</h3>

**Since version:** `2.1` ∙ **Type:** `double` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `0.0`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults/itineraryFilters 

Filter P+R routes that consist of driving and walking by the minimum fraction of the driving using of _time_.

This filters out results that consist of driving plus a very long walk leg at the end. A value of
`0.3` means that a minimum of 30% of the total time must be spent in the car in order for the
result to be included. However, if there is only a single result, it is never filtered.


<h3 id="rd_if_removeItinerariesWithSameRoutesAndStops">removeItinerariesWithSameRoutesAndStops</h3>

**Since version:** `2.2` ∙ **Type:** `boolean` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `false`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults/itineraryFilters 

Set to true if you want to list only the first itinerary  which goes through the same stops and routes.

Itineraries visiting the same set of stops and riding the exact same routes, departing later are removed from the result.

<h3 id="rd_if_transitGeneralizedCostLimit">transitGeneralizedCostLimit</h3>

**Since version:** `2.1` ∙ **Type:** `object` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults/itineraryFilters 

A relative limit for the generalized-cost for transit itineraries.

The filter compares all itineraries against every other itinerary. If the generalized-cost plus a
`transitGeneralizedCostLimit` is higher than the other generalized-cost, then the itinerary is
dropped. The `transitGeneralizedCostLimit` is calculated using the `costLimitFunction` plus a
*relative cost* for the distance in time between the itineraries. The *relative cost* is the
`intervalRelaxFactor` multiplied with the interval in seconds. To set the `costLimitFunction` to be
_1 hour plus 2 times cost_ use: `3600 + 2.0 x`. To set an absolute value(3000s) use: `3000 + 0x`


<h3 id="rd_if_transitGeneralizedCostLimit_costLimitFunction">costLimitFunction</h3>

**Since version:** `2.2` ∙ **Type:** `linear-function` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `"f(x) = 900 + 1.5 x"`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults/itineraryFilters/transitGeneralizedCostLimit

**Path:** /routingDefaults 

Tags which are required to use a vehicle parking. If empty, no tags are required.

<h3 id="rd_transferOptimization">transferOptimization</h3>

**Since version:** `2.1` ∙ **Type:** `object` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults 

Optimize where a transfer between to trip happens. 

The main purpose of transfer optimization is to handle cases where it is possible to transfer
between two routes at more than one point (pair of stops). The transfer optimization ensures that
transfers occur at the best possible location. By post-processing all paths returned by the router,
OTP can apply sophisticated calculations that are too slow or not algorithmically valid within
Raptor. Transfers are optimized is done after the Raptor search and before the paths are passed
to the itinerary-filter-chain.

To toggle transfer optimization on or off use the OTPFeature `OptimizeTransfers` (default is on).
You should leave this on unless there is a critical issue with it. The OTPFeature
`GuaranteedTransfers` will toggle on and off the priority optimization (part of OptimizeTransfers).

The optimized transfer service will try to, in order:

1. Use transfer priority. This includes stay-seated and guaranteed transfers.
2. Use the transfers with the best distribution of the wait-time, and avoid very short transfers.
3. Avoid back-travel
4. Boost stop-priority to select preferred and recommended stops.

If two paths have the same transfer priority level, then we break the tie by looking at waiting
times. The goal is to maximize the wait-time for each stop, avoiding situations where there is
little time available to make the transfer. This is balanced with the generalized-cost. The cost
is adjusted with a new cost for wait-time (optimized-wait-time-cost).

The defaults should work fine, but if you have results with short wait-times dominating a better
option or "back-travel", then try to increase the `minSafeWaitTimeFactor`,
`backTravelWaitTimeFactor` and/or `extraStopBoardAlightCostsFactor`.

For details on the logic/design see [transfer optimization](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/blob/dev-2.x/src/main/java/org/opentripplanner/routing/algorithm/transferoptimization/package.md)

<h3 id="rd_to_backTravelWaitTimeFactor">backTravelWaitTimeFactor</h3>

**Since version:** `2.1` ∙ **Type:** `double` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `1.0`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults/transferOptimization 

To reduce back-travel we favor waiting, this reduces the cost of waiting.

The wait time is used to prevent *back-travel*, the `backTravelWaitTimeFactor` is multiplied with the wait-time and subtracted from the optimized-transfer-cost.

<h3 id="rd_to_extraStopBoardAlightCostsFactor">extraStopBoardAlightCostsFactor</h3>

**Since version:** `2.1` ∙ **Type:** `double` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `0.0`   
**Path:** /routingDefaults/transferOptimization 

Add an extra board- and alight-cost for prioritized stops.

A stopBoardAlightCosts is added to the generalized-cost during routing. But this cost
cannot be too high, because that would add extra cost to the transfer, and favor other
alternative paths. But, when optimizing transfers, we do not have to take other paths
into consideration and can *boost* the stop-priority-cost to allow transfers to
take place at a preferred stop. The cost added during routing is already added to the
generalized-cost used as a base in the optimized transfer calculation. By setting this
parameter to 0, no extra cost is added, by setting it to `1.0` the stop-cost is
doubled. Stop priority is only supported by the NeTEx import, not GTFS.
