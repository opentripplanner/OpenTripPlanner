- Updated default map tile sets in the client because Mapquest is no longer gratis.
- Fix problem with empty list ??? [#1873](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/1873)
- Rewrite of intermediate places handling in GraphPathFinder. Original request is cloned for each intermediate path.
- Routes in GraphQL API Change "type" to "mode" and add "type" as route type to Route for GraphQL

- Updated to version 2.18 of Jersey to fix hanging threads in Grizzly.
- Removed confusing "Busish" and "Trainish" pseudo-modes.
- FareService for Seattle: allow specifying fares in GTFS instead of hard-coding them in Java. Senior/youth fare prices are given in an extra column in fare attributes. Per-trip fares are taken into consideration when calculating fares in this region.
- Update new linker to link to transitStops if no streets are found.
- Show the name supplied in the request for the origin/destination points in the response.
- Throw a trivialPath exception if start/end point are on the same edge.

## 0.20 (2016-06-10)

- Re-enabled Enunciate, which works properly with OTP now. This means we have auto-generated API docs.
- Make headsign and block ID visible in the Stop Viewer.
- NYC fare service: filter out non-NYC agencies.
- Optionally log all requests to a file.
- Make max distance for in-seat transfers (interlining) configurable. Previously it was hardcoded at 200m.

- Profile routing: use earliest arrival objective function on-street, properly handle TrivialPathExceptions.
- Fixed ID matching when applying AlertPatches.
- Fixed banning of agencies in multi agency feeds.
- More coherent handling of feed IDs as scope for GTFS IDs.
- Added transit service start and end timestamps to BuildInfo.
- Handle embeded router configuration for POSTed graphs and zips for building.
- Simplified router-config handling.
- Properly lazy-initialize profile routing stopClusters. Added stop clusters to the Index API.
- Completely removed the ill-advised path parser system, which was too clever for its own good.    
- Sort itineraries by total travel time rather than in-transit time.
- Rental bikes: allow loading generic KML.
- Removed the experimental TransportNetwork classes, which shared no code with the rest of OTP and were duplicated in the R5 project. There are still some elements that can be cleaned out when only R5 is used by Conveyal's analysis system. The broker code in OTP is now able to start up R5 workers for Analyst.
- Use the Conveyal fork of the OBA GTFS loader, so that we can add our own extensions to GTFS.
- Updated docs to offer Conveyal Maven repo as a place to get prebuilt OTP.
