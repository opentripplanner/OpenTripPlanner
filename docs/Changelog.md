- Update new linker to link to transitStops if no streets are found.
- Show the name supplied in the request for the origin/destination points in the response.

- Sort itineraries by total travel time rather than in-transit time.
- Rental bikes: allow loading generic KML.
- Removed the experimental TransportNetwork classes, which shared no code with the rest of OTP and were duplicated in the R5 project. There are still some elements that can be cleaned out when only R5 is used by Conveyal's analysis system. The broker code in OTP is now able to start up R5 workers for Analyst.
- Use the Conveyal fork of the OBA GTFS loader, so that we can add our own extensions to GTFS.
