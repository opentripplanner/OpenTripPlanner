# How to migrate from OTP1 to OTP2

## Command Line

The OTP2 command line parameters are different than in OTP1. Use the `--help` option to get the 
current documentation, and look at the [Basic Tutorial, Start up OPT](Basic-Tutorial.md#starting-otp) 
for examples. The possibility to build the graph in 2 steps (streets then transit) is new in OTP2. 
OTP2 does not support multiple routers.


## File Loading

OTP1 accesses all files using the local file system, no other _data-source_ is supported. In OTP2 we 
support accessing cloud storage. So far Google Cloud Storage is added and we plan to add support 
for AWS S3 as well. Config files (_otp-config.json, build-config.json, router-config.json_) are read 
from the local file system, while other files can be read/written from the local file-system or the
cloud. OTP2 supports mixing any data sources that are supported. 

OTP1 loads input data files (_DEM, OSM, GTFS, NeTEx_) based on the suffix (file extension). But for 
GTFS files OTP1 also opens the zip-file and looks for _stops.txt_. OTP2 identifies GTFS files by the 
name only: it will detect any zip-file or directory that contains "gtfs" as part of the name. All 
file types in OTP2 are resolved by matching the name with a regexp pattern. You can configure the 
patterns in the _build-config.json_ if the defaults do not suit you. 

OTP2 does not support multiple routers, but you can load as many GTFS and/or NeTEx feeds as 
you want into a single instance of OTP2.


## Build Config

New parameters:

 - `transitServiceStart` Limit the import of transit services to the given *start* date. Default: `-P1Y`
 - `transitServiceEnd` Limit the import of transit services to the given *end* date. *Inclusive*. Default: `P3Y`


These properties changed names from:

 - `htmlAnnotations` to `dataImportReport`
 - `maxHtmlAnnotationsPerFile` to `maxDataImportIssuesPerFile`
 - `boardTimes` to `routingDefaults.boardSlackByMode`
 - `alightTimes` to `routingDefaults.alightSlackByMode`
 
These parameters are no longer supported:

 - `stopClusterMode` 
 - `parentStopLinking`
 - `stationTransfers`
 
 OTP2 records the "parentStation" relationship between stops and stations in its internal transit 
 model, based on the GTFS and/or NeTEx input. This enables OTP to search from all stop in a station 
 _without_ walking/waiting when the request from/to input field is a station id. There is no way to 
 automatically infer this parent station relationship based on geographic proximity in OTP2. 
 
 Transfers in OTP2 are generated based on the stop location and the OSM data or GTFS Pathways. In 
 future versions of OTP2 we also want to support generating simple transfers based on 
 "line-of-sight" if no pathways or OSM data exist. See issue
 [#3204](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues/3204).
 
 Cleaning and patching input data is NOT a core feature of OTP, but anyone is welcome to implement 
 a sandbox plugin to patch data. So, if any of the features above are needed they can be ported
 from OTP1 into an OTP2 sandbox feature.
 
 
## Router Config

See the [Router Configuration](Configuration.md#router-configuration) for a description of the 
new and existing routing parameters.

New parameters:

 - `streetRoutingTimeout` Maximum time limit for street route queries. Replace the old `timeout`.
 - `transit` Transit tuning parameters, configure the raptor router. A set of parameters to tune 
             the Raptor transit router. 
 - `itineraryFilters` Configure itinerary filters that may modify itineraries, sort them, and 
                      filter away less preferable results.            
 
These parameters are no longer supported:

 - `timeout` Replaced by `streetRoutingTimeout`
 - `timeouts` OTP1 searches the graph many times, while OTP2 do one search finding multiple results
              in one search. So, there is no need for this parameter.
 - `boardTimes` is replaced by `request` parameter `boardSlack` and `boardSlackForMode`.
 - `alightTimes` is replaced by `request` parameter `alightSlack` and `alightSlackForMode`.
 
   
## REST API
  
### Trip Planning 

Support for XML as a request/response format is removed. The only supported format is JSON.

#### Query parameter changes

A lot of the query parameters in the REST API are ignored/deprecated, see the [RoutingRequest](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/blob/v2.0.0/src/main/java/org/opentripplanner/routing/api/request/RoutingRequest.java) 
 and the [RoutingResource](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/blob/v2.0.0/src/main/java/org/opentripplanner/api/common/RoutingResource.java)
 class for the documentation on what is now supported in 2.0. A few features did not make it into 
 the 2.0, but is sheduled for the 2.1 release.
 See [GitHub issues 2.1](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2.1).  
 
 
The following parameters are missing in OTP2 but will be added:
 
  - `startingTransitTripId` The ability to plan a trip from on board a vehicle should be implemented 
    by Q1 2021.
  - `intermediatePlaces` - ability to specify intermediate destinations along the route. It is not 
    certain when this will be implemented. 
  - `nonpreferredTransferCost`, `(un)preferredRoutes`, `(un)preferredAgencies` - these help diversify
    or customize the trips and operators visible in results. Due to the new transit routing
    algorithm, Entur plans to   completely rewrite these features, accounting for market-neutrality
    requirements and showing relevant trips and operators in local vs. intercity trips.
 
 
 Some features in OTP1 will not be present upon launch in OTP2, and they are proposed to be removed
 permanently from OTP2, but may require some development to support valid important cases:
 
  - `maxWalkDistance`, `maxTransferWalkDistance`, & `maxWait` - these parameters impose hard limits
    and are no longer the preferred way to reduce the amount of walking or waiting in returned 
    itineraries. In OTP2 the goal is to control this with `walkReluctance` and `waitReluctance`. 
    Internally some limits on walking and waiting do still exist, but they are set quite high so 
    trips with long walking or waiting times are still considered. Note that unlike in OTP1, if you
    do set your own max walk or wait time on an API request, it will apply to both transit searches
    and non-transit searches.
  - `maxHours` & `useRequestedDateTimeInMaxHours` - This is replaced by `searchWindow`, which
    limits the arrival or departure window of the trip
  - `worstTime` - This factor returns the “worst” trip in a depart after/arrive by search, i.e.
    the latest or earliest trip available. It is not a priority for current OTP2 users but could
    be added as a filter.
  - `waitAtBeginningFactor` - No longer necessary to weight the initial wait differently based on
    the the Range Raptor search algorithm, which no longer prefers a departure at one valid time
    over another. Filtering could be implemented on top of Raptor to show certain departure times
    before others.
  - `pathComparator` - The ability to set a sort order based on departure or arrival should be the
    domain of the API rather than the search. 
  - `startingTransitStopId` - duplicative with fromPlace
  - `onlyTransitTrips` - the new feature for specifying access, egress, transit and direct mode
    replace the need for this parameter.
  - `driveOnRight` - this is removed. You can specify the driving direction in your way property set.

Parameters that have changed:

  - `numItineraries` The parameter is no longer used to terminate the request when the 
    numItineraries is found, instead the new `searchWindow` parameter should be used to limit the
    search. In OTP2 it crops the list of itineraries AFTER the search is complete. This parameter
    is a post search filter function. The best option is to configure this on the server side and
    not use it as a client side input parameter. A side effect from reducing the result is that
    OTP2 cannot guarantee to find all pareto-optimal itineraries when paging. Also, a large
    search-window and a small `numItineraries` waste computer CPU calculation time. Consider
    tuning the `searchWindow` instead of setting this to a small value.
  - `modes` The REST API is unchanged, but is mapped into a new structure in the RoutingRequest. 
    This means not all combinations of non-transit modes that was available in OTP1 is available in
    OTP2.
  - `preferredAgencies`, `unpreferredAgencies`, `bannedAgencies` and `whiteListedAgencies` use
    feed-scoped ids. If you are using the ids directly from the Index API, no changes are needed.

    
 New parameters in OTP2:   

  - `searchWindow` Limit the departure window or arrival window for the routing search.
  - `boardSlackByMode` How much time ride a vehicle takes for each given mode.
  - `alightSlackByMode` How much time alighting a vehicle takes for each given mode.


#### Paging

 In OTP1 most client provided a way to page the results by looking at the trips returned and passing 
 in something like the `last-depature-time` + 1 minute to the next request, to get trips to add to 
 the already fetched results. In OTP2 the recommended way to do this is to use the new `TripPlan` 
 `metadata` returned by the router call.
  

#### Response changes

  - `metadata` is added to `TripPlan`. The `TripSearchMetadata` has three fields:
  - `searchWindowUsed`
  - `nextDateTime`
  - `prevDateTime`
  - `agencyId` in the `leg` is now feed-scoped and similarly to other ids, is prefixed with `<FEED_ID>:`
  - `debugOutput` in `TripPlan` has changed due to the different algorithms used in OTP version 1.x and 2.x.
  - The `totalTime` is left as is, `directStreetRouterTime`, `transitRouterTime`, `filteringTime` 
    and `renderingTime` are new fields.
  - `effectiveEndDate` is added to the `Alert`s


### Changes to the Index API

  - Error handling is improved, this is now consistently applied and uses build in framework support. 
  - The HTTP 400 and 404 response now contains a detailed error message in plain text targeted 
    developers to help understanding why the 400 or 404 was returned.
  - `Route`
  - Deprecated 'routeBikesAllowed' field removed.
  - `sortOrder` will be empty (missing) when empty, NOT -999 as before.
  - To access or references `TripPattern` use `tripPatternId`, not `code`. In OTP1 the
  `code` was used. The code was the same as the id without the feedId prefix. The `code`
  is removed from OTP2. Clients may not be affected by this change, unless they toke advantage 
  of the semantics in the old `code`.
  - The `mode` field is added to `Route`, it should probebly replace the `type`(unchanged). The 
    `RouteShort` is not chencged - it has the `mode` field.
  - `Pattern` (or `TripPattern`)  
    - The semantics of the `id` should NOT be used to access other related entities like `Route`, 
    the `routeId` is added to `TripPatternShort` to allow navigation to Route. 
  - `Trip`
    - The deprecated `tripBikesAllowed` is removed.
    - The `routeId` replace `route`. The route is no longer part of the trip. To obtain the Route
      object call the Index API with the routeId.
  - `Stop`
    - The new `stationId` is a feed-scoped-id to the parent station. It should be used instead of
      the deprecated ~~parentStation~~.
  - `StopShort`
    - The new `stationId` is a feed-scoped-id to the parent station. It should be used instead of
      the deprecated ~~cluster~~.
  - `Agency`
    - The `id` is now feed-scoped and similarly to other ids, is prefixed with `<FEED_ID>:`
  - `Alert`
    - `effectiveEndDate` is added to show the end time of the alert validity. 


### ServerInfo

The returned data structure is changed and more info is available.


### AlertPatcher 

The AlertPatcher, which was under the `/patch` path, is removed. In order to update alerts, please 
use a GTFS-RT Service Alert updater instead. An example of a simple service for producing static 
GTFS-RT Service Alert feed from JSON is [manual-gtfsrt](https://github.com/pailakka/manual-gtfsrt).

Querying for alerts has been moved under the index API, where `/alerts` can be appended to stop, 
route, trip and pattern.

### Analyst

The analyst API endpoints have been removed.

### Scripting

The scripting API endpoint has been removed.

### Updaters

- Floating bikes have been disabled by default in the GbfsBikeRentalDataSource unless explicitly 
turned on via OTPFeature.
