# Report API

The report API is a collection of reports generated as CSV files. The main use-case is to download
data for manual analyzes and verification. The CSV files should not be used as a service by another
programs, the report can be changed at any time - without any notice.

Feel free to add more reports and to add your organization to the contact info list.
