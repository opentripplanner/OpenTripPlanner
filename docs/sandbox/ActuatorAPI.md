## Contact Info
- Entur, Norway

## Changelog
- Initial implementation of readiness endpoint (November 2019)
- Prometheus metrics added using Micrometer (October 2021)
- GraphQL metrics added to prometheus export (November 2021)

## Documentation
This provides endpoints for checking the health status of the OTP instance. It can be useful when
running OTP in a container.

The API will be at the endpoint `http://localhost:8080/otp/actuators` and follows the Spring Boot
actuator API standard.

### Endpoints

#### /health

The health endpoints returns an 200 OK status code once the graph is loaded and all updaters are ready.
Otherwise, a 404 NOT FOUND is returned.

#### /prometheus

Prometheus metrics are returned using Micrometer. The default JVM and jersey metrics are enabled.

Also, GraphQL timing metrics are exported under `graphql.timer.query` and `graphql.timer.resolver`,
if the GraphQL endpoints are enabled.

### Configuration
To enable this you need to add the feature `ActuatorAPI`.
