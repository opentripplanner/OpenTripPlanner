## Changelog

## Documentation
This adds support for the GBFS service directory endpoint component located at https://github.com/entur/lahmu. OTP use the service directory to lookup and connect to all GBFS endpoints registered in the directory. This simplify the management of the GBFS enpoints, since multiple services/components like OTP can connect to the directory and get the necessary configuration from it. 

### Configuration
To enable this you need to specify a url for the `vehicleRentalServiceDirectory` in the `router-config.json`
