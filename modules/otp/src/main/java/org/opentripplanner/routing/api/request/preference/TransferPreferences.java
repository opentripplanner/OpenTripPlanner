   * the whole way. The actual fastest route is the 2/3 to the 4/5 at Nevins to the 6 at Union
   * Square, which takes half an hour. Even someone optimizing for fewest transfers doesn't want to
   * wait until midnight. Maybe they would be willing to walk to 7th Ave and take the Q to Union
   * Square, then transfer to the 6. If this takes less than optimize_transfer_penalty seconds, then
