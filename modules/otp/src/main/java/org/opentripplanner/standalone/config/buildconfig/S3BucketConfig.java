          """
In the United States, a high resolution [National Elevation Dataset](http://ned.usgs.gov/) is
available for the entire territory. It used to be possible for OTP to download NED tiles on the fly
from a rather complex USGS SOAP service. This process was somewhat unreliable and would greatly slow
down the graph building process. In any case the service has since been replaced. But the USGS would
also deliver the whole dataset in bulk if you 
[sent them a hard drive](https://web.archive.org/web/20150811051917/http://ned.usgs.gov:80/faq.html#DATA).
We did this many years back and uploaded the entire data set to Amazon AWS S3. OpenTripPlanner
contains another module that can automatically fetch data in this format from any Amazon S3 copy of
the bulk data.

This `ned13` bucket is still available on S3 under a "requester pays" policy. As long as you specify
valid AWS account credentials you should be able to download tiles, and any bandwidth costs will be
billed to your AWS account.

Once the tiles are downloaded for a particular geographic area, OTP will keep them in local cache
for the next graph build operation. You should add the `--cache <directory>` command line parameter
to specify your NED tile cache location.
