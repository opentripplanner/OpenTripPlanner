/**
 * A TripTimes represents the arrival and departure times for a single trip in a timetable. It is
 * one of the core class used for transit routing. This interface allows different kind of trip
 * to implement their own trip times. Scheduled/planned trips should be immutable, real-time
 * trip times should allow updates and more info, frequency-based trips can use a more compact
 * implementation, and Flex may expose part of the trip as a "scheduled/regular" stop-to-stop
 * trip using this interface. All times are expressed as seconds since midnight (as in
 * GTFS). Unless stated otherwise, accessor methods which take an integer stop parameter refer to
 * the position within the trip's TripPattern (not its GTFS stop sequence for example).
