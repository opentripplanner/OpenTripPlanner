This package contains a GTFS loader library. It is made to be as tolerant as possible of errors in
the input, because a large proportion of GTFS feeds contain errors, and we want to be able to report
all of those errors rather than bailing out the first time we hit an exception or missing field.

This package is currently in the OpenTripPlanner repository to avoid dependency mismatches during
development, but should be written such that it functions as an independent library.
