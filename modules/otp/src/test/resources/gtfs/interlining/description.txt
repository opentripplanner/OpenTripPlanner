This feed contains two routes. Both routes start and end at the same transit stop, but they pass
through different intermediate stops. One route has several trips with the same block ID and the 
other does not. The stoptimes for the two routes are identical, but the one with interlining 
allows you to reach the destination without transferring. That one should be considered optimal, 
and the resulting route should contain no transfers.
