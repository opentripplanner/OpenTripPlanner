# Configuring OpenTripPlanner

## Base Directory

On the OTP2 command line you must always specify a single directory after all the switches. This
tells OTP2 where to look for any configuration files. By default OTP will also scan this directory
for input files to build a graph (GTFS, OSM, elevation, and base street graphs) or the `graph.obj`
file to load when starting a server.

A typical OTP2 directory for a New York City graph might include the following:

```
otp-config.json
build-config.json
router-config.json
new-york-city-no-buildings.osm.pbf
nyc-elevation.tiff
long-island-rail-road.gtfs.zip
mta-new-york-city-transit.gtfs.zip
port-authority-of-new-york-new-jersey.gtfs.zip
graph.obj
```

You could have more than one of these directories if you are building separate graphs for separate
regions. Each one should contain one or more GTFS feeds, a PBF OpenStreetMap file, some JSON
configuration files, and any output files such as `graph.obj`. For convenience, especially if you
work with only one graph at a time, you may want to place your OTP2 JAR file in this same directory.
Note that file types are detected through a case-insensitive combination of file extension and words
within the file name. GTFS file names must end in `.zip` and contain the letters `gtfs`, and OSM
files must end in `.pbf`.

It is also possible to provide a list of input files in the configuration, which will override the
default behavior of scanning the base directory for input files. Scanning is overridden
independently for each file type, and can point to remote cloud storage with arbitrary URIs.
See [the storage section](Configuration.md#Storage) for further details.

## Three Scopes of Configuration

OTP is configured via three configuration JSON files which are read from the directory specified on
its command line. We try to provide sensible defaults for every option, so all three of these files
are optional, as are all the options within each file. Each configuration file corresponds to
options that are relevant at a particular phase of OTP usage.

Options and parameters that are taken into account during the graph building process will be "baked
into" the graph, and cannot be changed later in a running server. These are specified
in `build-config.json`. Other details of OTP operation can be modified without rebuilding the graph.
These run-time configuration options are found in `router-config.json`. Finally, `otp-config.json`
contains simple switches that enable or disable system-wide features.

## Configuration types

The OTP configuration files use the JSON file format. OTP allows comments and unquoted field names
in the JSON configuration files to be more human-friendly. OTP supports all the basic JSON types:
nested objects `{...}`, arrays `[]`, numbers `789.0` and boolean `true` or `false`. In addition to
these basic types some configuration parameters are parsed with some restrictions. In the
documentation below we will refer to the following types:

## System environment and project information substitution

OTP supports injecting system environment variables and project information parameters into the
configuration. A pattern like `${VAR_NAME}` in a configuration file is substituted with an
environment variable with name `VAR_NAME`. The substitution is done BEFORE the JSON is parsed, so
both json keys and values are subject to substitution. This is useful if you want OTPs version number
to be part of the _graph-file-name_, or you want to inject credentials in a cloud based deployment.

```JSON
{
    "gsCredentials": "${GCS_SERVICE_CREDENTIALS}",
    "graph": "file:///var/otp/graph-${otp.serialization.version.id}.obj"
}
```     

In the example above the environment variable `GCS_SERVICE_CREDENTIALS` on the local machine where
OTP is deployed is injected into the config. Also, the OTP serialization version id is injected.

The project information variables available are:

- `maven.version`
- `maven.version.short`
- `maven.version.major`
- `maven.version.minor`
- `maven.version.patch`
- `maven.version.qualifier`
- `git.branch`
- `git.commit`
- `git.commit.timestamp`
- `graph.file.header`
- `otp.serialization.version.id`

## Config version

All three configuration files have an optional `configVersion` property. The property can be used to
version the configuration in a deployment pipeline. The `configVersion` is not used by OTP in any
way, but is logged at startup and is available as part of the _server-info_ data in the REST API.
The intended usage is to be able to check which version of the configuration the graph was build
with and which version the router uses. In an deployment with many OTP instances it can be useful to
ask an instance about the version, instead of tracking the deployment pipeline backwards to find the
version used. How you inject a version into the configuration file is up to you, but you can do it
in your build-pipeline, at deployment time or use system environment variable substitution.

## OTP Serialization version id and _Graph.obj_ file header

OTP has a _OTP Serialization Version Id_ maintained in the pom.xml_ file. OTP stores the id in the
serialized _Graph.obj_ file header, allowing OTP to check for compatibility issues when loading the
graph. The header info is available to configuration substitution:

- `${graph.file.header}` Will expand to: `OpenTripPlannerGraph;0000007;`
- `${otp.serialization.version.id}` Will expand to: `7`

The intended usage is to be able to have a graph build pipeline that "knows" the matching graph and
OTP planner instance. For example, you may build new graphs for every OTP serialization
version id in use by the planning OTP instances you have deployed and plan to deploy. This way you
can roll forward and backward new OTP instances without worrying about building new graphs.

There are various ways to access this information. To get the `Graph.obj` serialization version id
you can run the following bash command:

- `head -c 29 Graph.obj ==>  OpenTripPlannerGraph;0000007;` (file header)
- `head -c 28 Graph.obj | tail -c 7 ==>  0000007`  (version id)

The Maven _pom.xml_, the _META-INF/MANIFEST.MF_, the OTP command line(`--serializationVersionId`), 
log start-up messages and all OTP APIs can be used to get the OTP Serialization Version Id.

## Include file directive

It is possible to inject the contents of another file into a configuration file. This makes it
possible to keep parts of the configuration in separate files. To include the contents of a file,
use
`${includeFile:FILE_NAME}`. The `FILE_NAME` must be the name of a file in the configuration
directory. Relative paths are not supported.

To allow both files (the configuration file and the injected file) to be valid JSON files, a special
case is supported. If the include file directive is quoted, then the quotes are removed, if the 
text inserted is valid JSON (starts with `{` and ends with `}`). 

Variable substitution is performed on configuration file after the include file directive; Hence
variable substitution is also performed on the text in the injected file.

Here is an example including variable substitution, assuming version 2.6.0 of OTP:

```JSON
// build-config.json
{
  "transitFeeds" : "${includeFile:transit.json}"
} 
``` 

```JSON
// transit.json
[
  {
  "source": "netex-v${maven.version.short}.obj"
}
]
``` 

The result will look like this:

```JSON
{
      "transitFeeds": [
        {
          "source": "netex-v2.6.0.obj"
        }
      ]
} 
``` 

## System-wide Configuration

Using the file `otp-config.json` you can enable or disable different APIs and experimental
[Sandbox Extensions](SandboxExtension.md). By default, all supported APIs are enabled and all
sandbox features are disabled. So for most OTP2 use cases it is not necessary to create this file.
Features that can be toggled in this file are generally only affect the routing phase of OTP2 usage,
but for consistency all such "feature flags", even those that would affect graph building, are
managed in this one file.

| `LegacyRestApi`                            | Enable legacy REST API. This API will be removed in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                    |    ✓️   |

## JVM configuration

This section contains general recommendations for tuning the JVM in a production environment.  
It focuses mainly on garbage collection configuration and memory settings.  
See [Garbage Collector Tuning](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/gctuning/introduction-garbage-collection-tuning.html) for general information on garbage collection.  
See [Large Pages in Java](https://kstefanj.github.io/2021/05/19/large-pages-and-java.html) and  [Transparent Huge Pages](https://shipilev.net/jvm/anatomy-quarks/2-transparent-huge-pages) for general information on large memory pages.


### OTP server

The OTP server processes concurrent routing requests in real time.  
The main optimization goal for the OTP server is minimizing response time.


#### Garbage collector
 
- The G1 garbage collector (default since Java 9) offers a good compromise between low latency (i.e. low GC pause time) and GC overhead.
- If latency spikes are an issue, the ZGC garbage collector is an alternative. It produces in general more overhead than G1.  


#### Memory settings 
 
- Using Large Memory Pages can reduce pressure on the TLB cache and increase performance.  
- It is in general not recommended to use large memory page in _Transparent Huge Page_ mode (`-XX:+UseTransparentHugePages`) for latency-sensitive applications, since memory is allocated on-demand and this can induce latency spikes if the memory is fragmented.  
  Thus _TLBFS_ mode (`-XX:+UseHugeTLBFS`) should be the first choice.
- If _TLBFS_ mode is not an option,  _Transparent Huge Page_ mode (`-XX:+UseTransparentHugePages`) can be used instead, with additional provisions to mitigate the risk of latency spikes:  
The physical memory can be committed upfront, at JVM startup time. This can be done by forcing a fixed heap size and pre-touching the memory.  
Example: `-Xms18g -Xmx18g -XX:+UseTransparentHugePages -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch`  


### Graph Builder

The Graph Builder is the non-interactive mode used to build street graphs and transit graphs.     
The main optimization goal for the Graph Builder is minimizing total build time.  


#### Garbage collector
 
- In theory, the Parallel garbage collector offers the best throughput.  
In practice, it can be challenging to optimize the Parallel GC to build both a street graph and a transit graph, the memory usage patterns being different. 
- The G1 garbage collector provides in general a good compromise.  


#### Memory settings 
 
- Using Large Memory Pages can reduce pressure on the TLB cache and increase performance.  
- Since latency is not an issue, Large Memory Pages can be used indifferently in _TLBFS_ mode (`-XX:+UseHugeTLBFS`) or _Transparent Huge Page_ mode (`-XX:+UseTransparentHugePages`)
