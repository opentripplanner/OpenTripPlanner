# OpenTripPlanner 2

**OpenTripPlanner** (OTP) is an open source multi-modal trip planner, focusing on travel by
scheduled public transportation in combination with bicycling, walking, and mobility services
including bike share and ride hailing. Its server component runs on any platform with a Java virtual
machine (including Linux, Mac, and Windows). It exposes GraphQL APIs that can be accessed
by various clients including open source Javascript components and native mobile applications. It
builds its representation of the transportation network from open data in open standard file
formats (primarily GTFS and OpenStreetMap). It applies real-time updates and alerts with immediate
visibility to clients, finding itineraries that account for disruptions and service changes. OTP is
released under the [LGPL license](https://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0). As of 2020, the
codebase has been in active development for over ten years, and is relied upon by transportation
authorities and travel planning applications in [deployments](Deployments.md) around the world.

# Audience

The end users of OTP are the millions of people who rely on it to help plan their daily travel,
often without even knowing they are using OTP. As an infrastructure component, installation and
configuration of OTP tends to be somewhat technical and essentially invisible to those end users.
This documentation is intended for people who wish to perform such deployments of OTP without
necessarily diving into the internal details of the software.

For members of the OTP community interested in software development, additional documentation
detailing algorithms, data structures etc. is available as markdown files within the source code
packages. It can be read in your IDE or when browsing the source tree on Github. See
[OTP Architecture](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/blob/dev-2.x/ARCHITECTURE.md).

# Quick Start

We encourage you to read the introductory sections of this documentation to familiarize yourself
with OpenTripPlanner use cases and configuration. But if you want to get started right away running
your own OTP instance, the best place to start is the [Basic Tutorial](Basic-Tutorial.md) page.

# Getting help

The fastest way to get help is to use our [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner) where most of the core developers are. Bug reports may be filed via the Github [issue tracker](https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/issues). The issue tracker is not intended for support questions or discussions. Please use the chat for this purpose. The OpenTripPlanner [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/opentripplanner-users) is treated as a legacy communications channel and used almost exclusively for project announcements. Again, please direct development and support discussions to the Gitter chat.

# Financial and In-Kind Support

OpenTripPlanner is a member project of Software Freedom Conservancy, a 501(c)(3) organization
incorporated in New York, and donations made to it are fully tax-deductible to the extent permitted
by law. Donations can be made by credit card, wire transfer or paper check. Please
contact <accounting@sfconservancy.org> for instructions.

OTP development is primarily carried out by full-time software engineers employed by transportation
authorities and consultancies. Even with funding, it can be difficult to engage staff who have the
specialized skill set required. Therefore, one of the best ways to support OTP is to allocate
software development staff at your organization with transportation domain knowledge to participate
in weekly development meetings and contribute to this effort. This also builds connections between
organizations favoring open source collaboration.
