# Mapbox Vector Tiles API

## Documentation

This API produces [Mapbox vector tiles](https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/reference/), which are
used by [Digitransit-ui](https://github.com/HSLdevcom/digitransit-ui) and 
[`otp-react-redux`](https://github.com/opentripplanner/otp-react-redux) to show information about
public transit entities on the map.

The tiles can be fetched from `/otp/routers/{routerId}/vectorTiles/{layers}/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf`,
where `layers` is a comma separated list of layer names from the configuration.

Maplibre/Mapbox GL JS also requires a tilejson.json endpoint which is available at
`/otp/routers/{routerId}/vectorTiles/{layers}/tilejson.json`.

Translatable fields in the tiles are translated based on the `accept-language` header in requests.
Currently, only the language with the highest priority from the header is used.

### Configuration

To enable this you need to add the feature `otp-config.json`.

```json
// otp-config.json
{
  "otpFeatures": {
    "SandboxAPIMapboxVectorTilesApi": true
  }
}
```

The feature must be configured in `router-config.json` as follows

```JSON

    ] 
  }
}
```

For each layer, the configuration includes:

- `name` which is used in the url to fetch tiles, and as the layer name in the vector tiles.
- `type` which tells the type of the layer. Currently supported:
    - `Stop`
    - `AreaStop`: Flex zones
    - `Station`
    - `VehicleRental`: all rental places: stations and free-floating vehicles
    - `VehicleRentalVehicle`: free-floating rental vehicles
    - `VehicleRentalStation`: rental stations
    - `VehicleParking`
    - `VehicleParkingGroup`

#### Details

<h4 id="vectorTiles_attribution">attribution</h4>

**Since version:** `2.5` ∙ **Type:** `string` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional`   
**Path:** /vectorTiles 

Custom attribution to be returned in `tilejson.json`

By default the, `attribution` property in `tilejson.json` is computed from the names and
URLs of the feed publishers.
If the OTP deployment contains many feeds, this can become very unwieldy.

This configuration parameter allows you to set the `attribution` to any string you wish
including HTML tags,
for example `<a href='https://trimet.org/mod'>Regional Partners</a>`.


<h4 id="vectorTiles_basePath">basePath</h4>

**Since version:** `2.5` ∙ **Type:** `string` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional`   
**Path:** /vectorTiles 

The path of the vector tile source URLs in `tilejson.json`.

This is useful if you have a proxy setup and rewrite the path that is passed to OTP.

If you don't configure this optional value then the path returned in `tilejson.json` is in
the format `/otp/routers/default/vectorTiles/layer1,layer2/{z}/{x}/{x}.pbf`.
If you, for example, set a value of `/otp_test/tiles` then the returned path changes to
`/otp_test/tiles/layer1,layer2/{z}/{x}/{x}.pbf`.

The protocol and host are always read from the incoming HTTP request. If you run OTP behind
a proxy then make sure to set the headers `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` to make OTP
return the protocol and host for the original request and not the proxied one.

**Note:** This does _not_ change the path that OTP itself serves the tiles or `tilejson.json`
responses but simply changes the URLs listed in `tilejson.json`. The rewriting of the path
is expected to be handled by a proxy.


<h4 id="vectorTiles_layers">layers</h4>

**Since version:** `2.0` ∙ **Type:** `object[]` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional`   
**Path:** /vectorTiles 

Configuration of the individual layers for the Mapbox vector tiles.

<h4 id="vectorTiles_layers_0_cacheMaxSeconds">cacheMaxSeconds</h4>

**Since version:** `2.0` ∙ **Type:** `integer` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `-1`   
**Path:** /vectorTiles/layers/[0] 

Sets the cache header in the response.

The lowest value of the layers included is selected.

<h4 id="vectorTiles_layers_0_expansionFactor">expansionFactor</h4>

**Since version:** `2.0` ∙ **Type:** `double` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `0.25`   
**Path:** /vectorTiles/layers/[0] 

How far outside its boundaries should the tile contain information.

The value is a fraction of the tile size. If you are having problem with icons and shapes being clipped at tile edges, then increase this number.

<h4 id="vectorTiles_layers_0_filter">filter</h4>

**Since version:** `2.6` ∙ **Type:** `enum` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Optional` ∙ **Default value:** `"none"`   
**Path:** /vectorTiles/layers/[0]   
**Enum values:** `none` | `sunday-to-sunday-service-week`

Reduce the result set of a layer further by a specific filter.

This is useful for when the schema of a layer, say stops, should remain unchanged but some
elements should not be included in the result.


<h4 id="vectorTiles_layers_0_mapper">mapper</h4>

**Since version:** `2.0` ∙ **Type:** `string` ∙ **Cardinality:** `Required`   
**Path:** /vectorTiles/layers/[0] 

Describes the mapper converting from the OTP model entities to the vector tile properties.

Currently `Digitransit` is supported for all layer types.

### Extending

If more generic layers are created for this API, the code should be moved out from the sandbox, into 
the core, perhaps potentially leaving specific property mappers in place.

#### Creating a new layer

In order to create a new type of layer, you need to create a new class extending `LayerBuilder<T>`.
You need to implement two methods, `List<Geometry> getGeometries(Envelope query)`, which returns a
list of geometries, with an object of type `T` as their userData in the geometry,
and `double getExpansionFactor()`, which describes how much information outside the tile bounds
should be included. This layer then needs to be added into `VectorTilesResource.layers`, with a
new `LayerType` enum as the key, and the class constructor as the value.

A new mapper needs to be added every time a new layer is added. See below for information.

#### Creating a new mapper

The mapping contains information of what data to include in the vector tiles. The mappers are
defined per layer.

In order to create a new mapper for a layer, you need to create a new class
extending `PropertyMapper<T>`. In that class, you need to implement the
method `Collection<KeyValue<String, Object>> map(T input)`. The type T is dependent on the layer for which
you implement the mapper for. It needs to return a list of attributes, as key-value pairs which will
be written into the vector tile.

The mapper needs to be added to the `mappers` map in the layer, with a new `MapperType` enum as the
key, and a function to create the mapper, with a `Graph` object as a parameter, as the value.
