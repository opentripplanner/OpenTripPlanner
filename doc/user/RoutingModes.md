This page is intended as an exhaustive listing of what OTP's routing engine is capable of and 
therefore documents internal names. Since OTP has multiple APIs where each works slightly differently,
please consult your API documentation on how to select the appropriate mode.

<h2 id="Street modes">Street modes</h2>

Routing modes on streets, including walking, biking, driving, and car-sharing.

<h4 id="BIKE">BIKE</h4>

Cycling for the entirety of the route or taking a bicycle onto the public transport and cycling from the arrival station to the destination.

Taking a bicycle onto transit is only possible if information about the permission to do so is supplied in the source data. In GTFS this field
is called `bikesAllowed`.


<h4 id="BIKE_RENTAL">BIKE_RENTAL</h4>

Taking a rented, shared-mobility bike for part or the entirety of the route.

_Prerequisite:_ Vehicle or station locations need to be added to OTP from dynamic data feeds.
See [Configuring GBFS](UpdaterConfig.md#gbfs-vehicle-rental-systems) on how to add one.


<h4 id="BIKE_TO_PARK">BIKE_TO_PARK</h4>

Leaving the bicycle at the departure station and walking from the arrival station to the destination.
This mode needs to be combined with at least one transit mode otherwise it behaves like an ordinary bicycle journey.

_Prerequisite:_ Bicycle parking stations present in the OSM file and visible to OTP by enabling the property `staticBikeParkAndRide` during graph build.


<h4 id="CAR">CAR</h4>

Driving your own car the entirety of the route.
This can be combined with transit, where will return routes with a [Kiss & Ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_and_ride#Kiss_and_ride_/_kiss_and_fly) component.
This means that the car is not parked in a permanent parking area but rather the passenger is dropped off (for example, at an airport) and the driver continues driving the car away from the drop off location.


<h4 id="CAR_HAILING">CAR_HAILING</h4>

Using a car hailing app like Uber or Lyft to get to a train station or all the way to the destination.

See [the sandbox documentation](sandbox/RideHailing.md) on how to configure it.


<h4 id="CAR_PICKUP">CAR_PICKUP</h4>

Walking to a pickup point along the road, driving to a drop-off point along the road, and walking the rest of the way. <br/> This can include various taxi-services or kiss & ride.

<h4 id="CAR_RENTAL">CAR_RENTAL</h4>

Walk to a car rental point, drive to a car rental drop-off point and walk the rest of the way.
This can include car rental at fixed locations or free-floating services.

_Prerequisite:_ Vehicle or station locations need to be added to OTP from dynamic data feeds.
See [Configuring GBFS](UpdaterConfig.md#gbfs-vehicle-rental-systems) on how to add one.


<h4 id="CAR_TO_PARK">CAR_TO_PARK</h4>

Driving a car to the park-and-ride facilities near a station and taking publictransport.
This mode needs to be combined with at least one transit mode otherwise, it behaves like an ordinary car journey.
_Prerequisite:_ Park-and-ride areas near the stations need to be present in the OSM input file.


<h4 id="FLEXIBLE">FLEXIBLE</h4>

Encompasses all types of on-demand and flexible transportation for example GTFS Flex or NeTEx Flexible Stop Places.

<h4 id="SCOOTER_RENTAL">SCOOTER_RENTAL</h4>

Walking to a scooter rental point, riding a scooter to a scooter rental drop-off point, and walking the rest of the way.
This can include scooter rental at fixed locations or free-floating services.

_Prerequisite:_ Vehicle or station locations need to be added to OTP from dynamic data feeds.
See [Configuring GBFS](UpdaterConfig.md#gbfs-vehicle-rental-systems) on how to add one.


<h4 id="WALK">WALK</h4>

Walking some or all of the way of the route.

<h2 id="Transit modes">Transit modes</h2>

Routing modes for transit, including rail, bus, ferry, etc. Equivalent to [GTFS `route_type`](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#routestxt) or to NeTEx TransportMode.
