OTP can also fetch real-time data about vehicle rental networks
including the number of vehicles and free parking spaces at each station. We support vehicle rental
systems that use the [GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs) standard, which can describe a variety of 
shared mobility services.

OTP has partial support for both GBFS v1, v2.3 and v3.0 ([list of known GBFS feeds](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv)). 
Furthermore, support is limited to the following form factors:

- bicycle
- scooter
- car
